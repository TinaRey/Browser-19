      "Motivation: Wuhan pneumonia is an acute infectious disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). It is being treated as a Class A infectious disease though it was classified as Class B according to the Infectious Disease Prevention Act of China. Accurate estimation of the incubation period of the coronavirus is essential to the prevention and control. However, it remains unclear about its exact incubation period though it is believed that symptoms of COVID-19 can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 or even more after exposure. The accurate incubation period calculation requires original chain-of-infection data that may not be fully available in the Wuhan regions. In this study, we aim to accurately calculate the incubation period of COVID-19 by taking advantage of the chain-of-infection data, which is well-documented and epidemiologically informative, outside the Wuhan regions. Methods: We acquired and collected officially reported COVID-19 data from 10 regions in China except for Hubei province. To achieve the accurate calculation of the incubation period, we only involved the officially confirmed cases with a clear history of exposure and time of onset. We excluded those without relevant epidemiological descriptions, working or living in Wuhan for a long time, or hard to determine the possible exposure time. We proposed a Monte Caro simulation approach to estimate the incubation of COVID-19 as well as employed nonparametric ways. We also employed manifold learning and related statistical analysis to decipher the incubation relationships between different age/gender groups. Result: The incubation period of COVID-19 did not follow general incubation distributions such as lognormal, Weibull, and Gamma distributions. We estimated that the mean and median of its incubation were 5.84 and 5.0 days via bootstrap and proposed Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the incubation periods of the groups with age>=40 years and age<40 years demonstrated a statistically significant difference. The former group had a longer incubation period and a larger variance than the latter. It further suggested that different quarantine time should be applied to the groups for their different incubation periods. Our machine learning analysis also showed that the two groups were linearly separable. incubation of COVID-19 along with previous statistical analysis. Our results further indicated that the incubation difference between males and females did not demonstrate a statistical significance.\n",

      "Rationale: In late December 2019, an outbreak of acute respiratory illness, now officially named as COVID-19, or coronavirus disease 2019, emerged in Wuhan, China, now spreading across the whole country and world. More data were needed to understand the clinical characteristics of the disease. Objectives: To study the epidemiology, clinical features and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Methods: we performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 221 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at a university hospital. Measurements and Main Results: The median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities. Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea. On admission, 33.0% patients showed leukopenia and 73.8% showed lymphopenia. In addition, the severe patients suffered a higher rate of co-infections with bacteria or fungus and they were more likely to developing complications. As of February 15, 2020, 19.0% patients had been discharged and 5.4% patients died. 80% of severe cases received ICU care, and 52.3% of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and the mortality rate of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%. Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Patients with elder age, chronic comorbidities, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count, procalcitonin level, co-infection and severe complications might increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes.

      "Rationale: COVID-19 have deprived many lives in Wuhan, China and caused global concerns. Few studies focused on clinical characteristics non-survivors hospitalized with COVID-19. Objectives: We aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of died patients with COVID-19 and tracked the causes of the rapid disease progression and death. Methods: 101 non-surviving patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this retrospective study. Clinical data were collected and compared between non-survivors who died within 3 days and after 3 days of admission. Multivariable regression analysis was used to analyze risk factors associated with rapid disease progression and death. Measurements and Main Results: Among included patients, median age was 71 years (IQR, 59-80), 60 (59.41%) were men. 82 (81.19%) had one or more comorbidities including hypertension (59 [58.42%]), diabetes (22 [21.78%]) etc. 100 (99.01%) suffered respiratory failure, 53 (52.48%) developed acute cardiac injury, acute kidney and liver injury occurred in 23 (22.77%) and 18 (17.82%) patients, respectively. Multivariable regression analysis showed that elevated high sensitivity troponin I (OR 2.68, 95%CI 1.31-5.49, P=0.007), neutrophils (OR 1.14, 95%CI 1.01-1.28, P=0.033) and depressed oxygen saturation (OR 0.94, 95%CI 0.89-0.99, P=0.027) on admission were associated with rapid death of patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: Older patients (>70 years) with comorbidities had a steeply increased risk of death with COVID-19. Respiratory failure, acute cardiac and kidney injury played a crucial role in the death of patients. Elevated high sensitivity troponin, neutrophils and depressed oxygen saturation predicted the rapid death of patients.\n",

      "Overview: Coronavirus to cut global growth to new lows ▀ The rapid spread of coronavirus will weaken China's GDP growth sharply in the short term, causing disruption for the rest of the world. We now expect global GDP growth to slow to just 1.9% y/y in Q1 this year and have lowered our forecast for 2020 as a whole from 2.5% to 2.3%, down from 2.6% in 2019. ▀ Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, there had been signs that the worst was over for both world trade and the manufacturing sector. However, this tentative optimism has been dashed by the current disruption. ▀ While the near-term impact of the virus is uncertain, the disruption to China will clearly be significant in Q1 ? we expect Chinese GDP growth to plunge to just 3.8% y/y. Even though growth there will rebound in Q2 and Q3, it will take time for the loss in activity to be fully recovered and we now expect GDP growth of just 5.4% for 2020 as a whole, a downward revision of 0.6pp from last month. ▀ Weaker Chinese imports and tourism and disruption to global supply chains will take a toll on the rest of the world, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. And the shock will exacerbate the ongoing slowdown in the US and may result in the eurozone barely expanding for a second quarter running in Q1. ▀ Weaker oil demand in the short term has prompted us to lower our Brent oil price forecast. We have cut our projection for growth in crude demand in 2020 by 0.2m b/d to 0.9 mb/d and now forecast Brent crude will average $62.4pb in 2020, down from about $65pb in our January forecast. ▀ Quarterly global growth is likely to strengthen a little in H2 this year as the disruption fades and firms make up for the lost output earlier in the year and the effect of China's policy response starts to feed through. But for 2020 overall, global growth is now likely to be just 2.3%, 0.2pp weaker than previously assumed as a result of the epidemic.\n",

      "It: Two Coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, causing generally mild respiratory tract infections in humans, were described in the XX c. Pandemic Coronaviruses were first discovered as late as in the XXI c.: SARS-HCoV in 2002 – causing severe respiratory tract infections (SARS) in China; MERS-HCoV in 2012 – circulating mostly on the Arabian Peninsula. The SARS epidemic ended in 2004 resulting in morbidity of >8000 and >770 deaths, while the MERS epidemic is still ongoing (>2000 ill, >700 deaths) although its intensity decreased. Both viruses are zoonotic and require at least two “host jumps” for the transmission of the infection to humans: for HCoV-SARS – from bat to palm civet and then to human; for HCoV-MERS – from bats to camels and subsequently to humans. Primary mode of transmission is droplet in close contact (<1 m), but both viruses remain active in aerosol (up to 24 h), so infection can be also spread by air (ventilation). The ability for human-to-human transmission is higher for HCoV-SARS than for HCoV-MERS (8 generations vs. 4, respectively). Moreover, there are differences in genome structure and pathogenic mechanisms: different receptor, cell entry mechanism, different way of host response modulation (e.g. inhibition of IFNβ cascade), etc. Probably, these differences influence the overall manifestation of the disease in humans. Infection caused by HCoV-MERS might manifest itself as ARDS, a mild-mannered and asymptomatic disease. HCoV-SARS infections seem to be associated with severe disease only. In this paper, a comparison of the structure of these viruses, the mechanisms underlying their ability to cross the interspecies barrier and to multiply in the human body, including modulation of IFNβ cascade, as well as routes of infection transmission and symptoms caused, were presented.\n",

      "CONTEXT: There have been few longitudinal studies of cytokine production in neonatally acquired HIV-1 infection and none in Asian or Chinese children. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether monitoring cytokine production could contribute to the better management of pediatric patients with HIV-1 infection. SETTING: Clinical Immunology Laboratory and Pediatrics Department, University Hospital, Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Ten Asian and 2 Eurasian children infected with HIV-1 by mother-to-child transmission were followed for up to 5 years while on treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Numbers of unstimulated and mitogen-activated cytokine-secreting cells (IFN-gamma, interleukin [IL]-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-alpha) were measured by ELISPOT assay at frequent intervals, and correlations were sought with CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts and viral loads. RESULTS: Mitogen-stimulated IL-2-secreting cells were directly associated with recovery of CD4+ cells. Correlations with viral load were found for Con A-induced IFN-gamma, Con A-induced IL-4, and unstimulated IL-10, suggesting that these cytokines were either suppressed by high virus levels or that higher cytokine levels suppressed virus. IFN-gamma, IL-2-, IL-4-, and IL-12-secreting cells induced by PHA, Con A, and/or SAC tended to increase for the first 3-4 years of treatment but declined thereafter. CONCLUSION: Alterations in cytokine profiles were not associated with adverse clinical events and there was little evidence to indicate that monitoring cytokine enzyme-linked immunospots (ELISPOTs) could contribute to pediatric patient management.\n",

      "CONTEXT: Body mass index (BMI), serum albumin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) appear to be major determinants of hospitalization. AIM: To determine the predictive ability of BMI, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA score), serum albumin, and CRP to assess the duration and outcome of mechanical ventilation (MV). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients aged >18 years who required mechanical ventilation (MV) were enrolled for the study. They were divided into two groups; patients who improved (Group 1), patients who expired (Group 2). Group 1 was further divided into two groups: patients on MV for <5 days (Group A), and patients on MV for >5days (Group B). BMI and SOFA score were calculated, and serum albumin and CRP were estimated. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Out of the 30 patients, 18 patients successfully improved after MV (Group 1) and 12 patients expired (Group 2). Among the 18 patients in group 1, ten patients improved within 5 days (Group A) and 8 patients after 5 days (Group B). SOFA score and CRP were significantly increased (P value 0.0003 and 0.0001, respectively) in group 2 when compared to group 1. CRP >24.2 mg/L or SOFA score >7 at the start of MV increases the probability of mortality by factor 13.08 or 3.92, respectively The above parameters did not show any statistical difference when group A was compared to group B. CONCLUSION: Simple, economic and easily accessible markers like CRP and assessment tools of critically ill patients with SOFA score are important determinants of possible outcomes of a patient from MV.\n",

      "Motivation: In the analysis of differential peptide peak intensities (i.e. abundance measures), LC-MS analyses with poor quality peptide abundance data can bias downstream statistical analyses and hence the biological interpretation for an otherwise high-quality dataset. Although considerable effort has been placed on assuring the quality of the peptide identification with respect to spectral processing, to date quality assessment of the subsequent peptide abundance data matrix has been limited to a subjective visual inspection of run-by-run correlation or individual peptide components. Identifying statistical outliers is a critical step in the processing of proteomics data as many of the downstream statistical analyses [e.g. analysis of variance (ANOVA)] rely upon accurate estimates of sample variance, and their results are influenced by extreme values. Results: We describe a novel multivariate statistical strategy for the identification of LC-MS runs with extreme peptide abundance distributions. Comparison with current method (run-by-run correlation) demonstrates a significantly better rate of identification of outlier runs by the multivariate strategy. Simulation studies also suggest that this strategy significantly outperforms correlation alone in the identification of statistically extreme liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) runs.

      "Motivation: Laboratory RNA structure determination is demanding and costly and thus, computational structure prediction is an important task. Single sequence methods for RNA secondary structure prediction are limited by the accuracy of the underlying folding model, if a structure is supported by a family of evolutionarily related sequences, one can be more confident that the prediction is accurate. RNA pseudoknots are functional elements, which have highly conserved structures. However, few comparative structure prediction methods can handle pseudoknots due to the computational complexity. Results: A comparative pseudoknot prediction method called DotKnot-PW is introduced based on structural comparison of secondary structure elements and H-type pseudoknot candidates. DotKnot-PW outperforms other methods from the literature on a hand-curated test set of RNA structures with experimental support.

      "Motivation: An important aspect of infectious disease research involves understanding the differences and commonalities in the infection mechanisms underlying various diseases. Systems biology-based approaches study infectious diseases by analyzing the interactions between the host species and the pathogen organisms. This work aims to combine the knowledge from experimental studies of host–pathogen interactions in several diseases to build stronger predictive models. Our approach is based on a formalism from machine learning called ‘multitask learning’, which considers the problem of building models across tasks that are related to each other. A ‘task’ in our scenario is the set of host–pathogen protein interactions involved in one disease. To integrate interactions from several tasks (i.e. diseases), our method exploits the similarity in the infection process across the diseases. In particular, we use the biological hypothesis that similar pathogens target the same critical biological processes in the host, in defining a common structure across the tasks. Results: Our current work on host–pathogen protein interaction prediction focuses on human as the host, and four bacterial species as pathogens. The multitask learning technique we develop uses a task-based regularization approach. We find that the resulting optimization problem is a difference of convex (DC) functions. To optimize, we implement a Convex–Concave procedure-based algorithm. We compare our integrative approach to baseline methods that build models on a single host–pathogen protein interaction dataset. Our results show that our approach outperforms the baselines on the training data. We further analyze the protein interaction predictions generated by the models, and find some interesting insights.

RESULTS: Limited data confirm that febrile illness is correlated with alterations in the body’s thermoregulatory system, with increases in metabolic rate, and with effects in fluid homeostasis. Human and animal studies demonstrate a decrease in muscle strength and endurance secondary to muscle catabolism in febrile illness. However, indirect evidence suggests that regular exercise enhances the immune response. No strong clinical research has been published on return to play during or following acute febrile illness, excluding mononucleosis and myocarditis. CONCLUSION: Fever is correlated with an increase in insensible fluid losses, dehydration, metabolic demands, and dysregulation of body temperature. Fever can have detrimental effects on the musculoskeletal system, including decreasing strength and endurance, generalized muscle catabolism, and increase in perceived fatigue. Participating in strenuous exercise during febrile illness can worsen the illness and has demonstrated increased lethality in animal models. No consensus recommendations support return to activity before resolution of fever, and training should be resumed gradually once fever and dehydration have resolved.\n",

      "RATIONALE: Emphysema and osteoporosis are epidemiologically associated diseases of cigarette smokers. The causal mechanism(s) linking these illnesses is unknown. We hypothesized autoimmune responses may be involved in both disorders. OBJECTIVES: To discover an antigen-specific autoimmune response associated with both emphysema and osteoporosis among smokers. METHODS: Replicate nonbiased discovery assays indicated that autoimmunity to glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone and cell surface signaling receptor, is present in many smokers. Subject assessments included spirometry, chest CT scans, dual x-ray absorptiometry, and immunoblots for anti-GRP78 IgG. Anti-GRP78 autoantibodies were isolated from patient plasma by affinity chromatography, leukocyte functions assessed by flow cytometry, and soluble metabolites and mediators measured by immunoassays. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Circulating anti-GRP78 IgG autoantibodies were detected in plasma specimens from 86 (32%) of the 265 smoking subjects. Anti-GRP78 autoantibodies were singularly prevalent among subjects with radiographic emphysema (OR 3.1, 95%CI 1.7–5.7, p = 0.003). Anti-GRP78 autoantibodies were also associated with osteoporosis (OR 4.7, 95%CI 1.7–13.3, p = 0.002), and increased circulating bone metabolites (p = 0.006). Among emphysematous subjects, GRP78 protein was an autoantigen of CD4 T-cells, stimulating lymphocyte proliferation (p = 0.0002) and IFN-gamma production (p = 0.03). Patient-derived anti-GRP78 autoantibodies had avidities for osteoclasts and macrophages, and increased macrophage NFkB phosphorylation (p = 0.005) and productions of IL-8, CCL-2, and MMP9 (p = 0.005, 0.007, 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Humoral and cellular GRP78 autoimmune responses in smokers have numerous biologically-relevant pro-inflammatory and other deleterious actions, and are associated with emphysema and osteoporosis. These findings may have relevance for the pathogenesis of smoking-associated diseases, and development of biomarker immunoassays and/or novel treatments for these disorders.\n",

      "RATIONALE: The family of natriuretic peptides (NPs), including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), exert important and diverse actions for cardiovascular and renal homeostasis. The autocrine and paracrine functions of the NPs are primarily mediated through the cellular membrane bound guanylyl cyclase-linked receptors GC-A (NPR-A) and GC-B (NPR-B). As the ligands and receptors each contain disulfide bonds, a regulatory role for the cell surface protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) was investigated. OBJECTIVE: We utilized complementary in vitro and in vivo models to determine the potential role of PDI in regulating the ability of the NPs to generate its second messenger, cyclic guanosine monophosphate. METHODS AND RESULTS: Inhibition of PDI attenuated the ability of ANP, BNP and CNP to generate cGMP in human mesangial cells (HMCs), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs), each of which were shown to express PDI. In LLC-PK1 cells, where PDI expression was undetectable by immunoblotting, PDI inhibition had a minimal effect on cGMP generation. Addition of PDI to cultured LLC-PK1 cells increased intracellular cGMP generation mediated by ANP. Inhibition of PDI in vivo attenuated NP-mediated generation of cGMP by ANP. Surface Plasmon Resonance demonstrated modest and differential binding of the natriuretic peptides with immobilized PDI in a cell free system. However, PDI was shown to co-localize on the surface of cells with GC-A and GC-B by co-immunoprecpitation and immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate for the first time that cell surface PDI expression and function regulate the capacity of natriuretic peptides to generate cGMP through interaction with their receptors.\n",

      "Motivation: Abstract shape analysis, first proposed in 2004, allows one to extract several relevant structures from the folding space of an RNA sequence, preferable to focusing in a single structure of minimal free energy. We report recent extensions to this approach. Results: We have rebuilt the original RNAshapes as a repository of components that allows us to integrate several established tools for RNA structure analysis: RNAshapes, RNAalishapes and pknotsRG, including its recent extension pKiss. As a spin-off, we obtain heretofore unavailable functionality: e. g. with pKiss, we can now perform abstract shape analysis for structures holding pseudoknots up to the complexity of kissing hairpin motifs. The new tool pAliKiss can predict kissing hairpin motifs from aligned sequences. Along with the integration, the functionality of the tools was also extended in manifold ways.

      "Motivation: The study of RNA virus populations is a challenging task. Each population of RNA virus is composed of a collection of different, yet related genomes often referred to as mutant spectra or quasispecies. Virologists using deep sequencing technologies face major obstacles when studying virus population dynamics, both experimentally and in natural settings due to the relatively high error rates of these technologies and the lack of high performance pipelines. In order to overcome these hurdles we developed a computational pipeline, termed ViVan (Viral Variance Analysis). ViVan is a complete pipeline facilitating the identification, characterization and comparison of sequence variance in deep sequenced virus populations. Results: Applying ViVan on deep sequenced data obtained from samples that were previously characterized by more classical approaches, we uncovered novel and potentially crucial aspects of virus populations. With our experimental work, we illustrate how ViVan can be used for studies ranging from the more practical, detection of resistant mutations and effects of antiviral treatments, to the more theoretical temporal characterization of the population in evolutionary studies.

      "Conclusion: Daily intake of 480 mg of BNO 1016 for 15 days is an effective treatment in acute viral rhinosinusitis. Objectives: The pooled efficacy data of two similar randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials were analyzed. Safety was evaluated on the basis of the individual trials. Methods: The efficacy analysis was based on 589 patients. Treatment was performed orally with either 3 × 160 mg BNO 1016 (n = 294) or 3 × placebo (n = 295) for 15 days. In both trials patients underwent five visits to the investigational sites. Symptoms were evaluated according to the EPOS 2012 guideline. Ultrasonography was used to confirm the diagnosis at onset of treatment and the remission of symptoms at the last visit. Efficacy was evaluated by the investigator as the mean major symptom score (MSS) at the end of treatment (visit 5, day 14). Patients reported symptoms and social/emotional consequences of rhinosinusitis using a quality of life questionnaire (SNOT-20 GAV). Results: MSS improved during the treatment period by a mean of 10.02 ± 1.61 score points to 2.47 ± 2.55 for BNO 1016 and of 9.87 ± 1.52 to 3.63 ± 3.63 for placebo. Differences between treatment groups at end of therapy (1.16 ± 3.14 score points; p < 0.0001) and patient-assessed quality of life (p = 0.0015) were statistically significant in favor of BNO 1016.\n",

      "Motivation: Deep sequencing of clinical samples is now an established tool for the detection of infectious pathogens, with direct medical applications. The large amount of data generated produces an opportunity to detect species even at very low levels, provided that computational tools can effectively profile the relevant metagenomic communities. Data interpretation is complicated by the fact that short sequencing reads can match multiple organisms and by the lack of completeness of existing databases, in particular for viral pathogens. Here we present metaMix, a Bayesian mixture model framework for resolving complex metagenomic mixtures. We show that the use of parallel Monte Carlo Markov chains for the exploration of the species space enables the identification of the set of species most likely to contribute to the mixture. Results: We demonstrate the greater accuracy of metaMix compared with relevant methods, particularly for profiling complex communities consisting of several related species. We designed metaMix specifically for the analysis of deep transcriptome sequencing datasets, with a focus on viral pathogen detection; however, the principles are generally applicable to all types of metagenomic mixtures.

      "CONTEXT: Microbial contamination, which occurs during dental procedures, has been a potential threat to dental professionals and individuals. There has been a growing concern over the role of bioaerosols in spread of various airborne infections and also to reduce the risk of bioaerosol contamination. AIMS: This study was to analyze the number of colony forming units (CFUs) in bioaerosols generated during ultrasonic scaling procedure as well as to evaluate the efficacy of chlorhexidine 0.12% (CHX) preprocedural mouth rinse and high volume evacuator (HVE) in minimizing the bioaerosol contamination. METHODS: About 45 individuals were divided into three Groups A, B and C. These groups underwent ultrasonic scaling before and after the use of CHX (0.12%), HVE and combination of CHX (0.12%) and HVE. Bioaerosols were collected on blood agar plates which were incubated at 37°C for 48 h, and the CFUs were counted with manual colony counting device. A comparison was also done between A versus B, B versus C and A versus C groups. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Student's t-test. RESULTS: We found a significant reduction in the CFUs when CHX (0.12%) preprocedural rinse (P < 0), or HVE (P < 0.001) or combination of both CHX (0.12%) and HVE were employed (P < 0.001). Maximum reduction in CFUs was observed when CHX (0.12%) and HVE were used in combination as compared to their individual use. A moderate significance was seen between A versus C groups but not with B versus C groups and A versus B groups. CONCLUSION: From our study, we conclude that individual methods such as CHX (0.12%) and HVE were useful to reduce the dental bioaerosols; however, combination of both CHX (0.12%) and HVE is more efficient to reduce dental bioaerosols than individual method.\n",

      "CONTEXT: Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a widespread pediatric disease caused primarily by human enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16). OBJECTIVE: This study reports a systematic review of the epidemiology of HFMD in Asia. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched up to December 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently assessed studies for epidemiologic and serologic information about prevalence and incidence of HFMD against predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers extracted answers for 8 specific research questions on HFMD epidemiology. The results are checked by 3 others. RESULTS: HFMD is found to be seasonal in temperate Asia with a summer peak and in subtropical Asia with spring and fall peaks, but not in tropical Asia; evidence of a climatic role was identified for temperate Japan. Risk factors for HFMD include hygiene, age, gender and social contacts, but most studies were underpowered to adjust rigorously for confounding variables. Both community-level and school-level transmission have been implicated, but their relative importance for HFMD is inconclusive. Epidemiologic indices are poorly understood: No supporting quantitative evidence was found for the incubation period of EV-A71; the symptomatic rate of EV-A71/Coxsackievirus A16 infection was from 10% to 71% in 4 studies; while the basic reproduction number was between 1.1 and 5.5 in 3 studies. The uncertainty in these estimates inhibits their use for further analysis. LIMITATIONS: Diversity of study designs complicates attempts to identify features of HFMD epidemiology. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge on HFMD remains insufficient to guide interventions such as the incorporation of an EV-A71 vaccine in pediatric vaccination schedules. Research is urgently needed to fill these gaps.\n",

      "RATIONALE: Medical masks are commonly used by sick individuals with influenza-like illness (ILI) to prevent spread of infections to others, but clinical efficacy data are absent. OBJECTIVE: Determine whether medical mask use by sick individuals with ILI protects well contacts from related respiratory infections. SETTING: 6 major hospitals in 2 districts of Beijing, China. DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: 245 index cases with ILI. INTERVENTION: Index cases with ILI were randomly allocated to medical mask (n=123) and control arms (n=122). Since 43 index cases in the control arm also used a mask during the study period, an as-treated post hoc analysis was performed by comparing outcomes among household members of index cases who used a mask (mask group) with household members of index cases who did not use a mask (no-mask group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary outcomes measured in household members were clinical respiratory illness, ILI and laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infection. RESULTS: In an intention-to-treat analysis, rates of clinical respiratory illness (relative risk (RR) 0.61, 95% CI 0.18 to 2.13), ILI (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.13) and laboratory-confirmed viral infections (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.54) were consistently lower in the mask arm compared with control, although not statistically significant. A post hoc comparison between the mask versus no-mask groups showed a protective effect against clinical respiratory illness, but not against ILI and laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates a potential benefit of medical masks for source control, but is limited by small sample size and low secondary attack rates. Larger trials are needed to confirm efficacy of medical masks as source control. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12613000852752; Results.\n",

      "CONTEXT: Evidence of the effect of continuous quality improvement (CQI) in public health and valid tools to judge that such effects are not fully formed. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to adapt and apply Shortell et al.'s (1998) four dimensions of CQI in an examination of a public health accountability and performance management initiative in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: In total, 24 semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with informants from public health units and the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. A web survey of public health managers in the province was also carried out. RESULTS: A mix of facilitators and barriers was identified. Leadership and organizational cultures, conducive to CQI success were evident. However, limitations in performance measurement and managerial discretion were key barriers. CONCLUSION: The four dimensions of CQI provided insight into both facilitators and barriers of CQI adoption in public health. Future research should compare the outcomes of public health CQI initiatives to the framework's stated facilitators and barriers.\n",

      "Rationale: Cell-free protein microarrays display naturally-folded proteins based on just-in-time in situ synthesis, and have made important contributions to basic and translational research. However, the risk of spot-to-spot cross-talk from protein diffusion during expression has limited the feature density of these arrays. Methods: In this work, we developed the Multiplexed Nucleic Acid Programmable Protein Array (M-NAPPA), which significantly increases the number of displayed proteins by multiplexing as many as five different gene plasmids within a printed spot. Results: Even when proteins of different sizes were displayed within the same feature, they were readily detected using protein-specific antibodies. Protein-protein interactions and serological antibody assays using human viral proteome microarrays demonstrated that comparable hits were detected by M-NAPPA and non-multiplexed NAPPA arrays. An ultra-high density proteome microarray displaying > 16k proteins on a single microscope slide was produced by combining M-NAPPA with a photolithography-based silicon nano-well platform. Finally, four new tuberculosis-related antigens in guinea pigs vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) were identified with M-NAPPA and validated with ELISA. Conclusion: All data demonstrate that multiplexing features on a protein microarray offer a cost-effective fabrication approach and have the potential to facilitate high throughput translational research.\n",

      "CONTEXT: During the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014-2015, close cooperation between the curative sector and the public health sector in the Netherlands was necessary for timely identification, referral, and investigation of patients with suspected Ebola virus disease (EVD). OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluated experiences in preparedness among stakeholders of both curative and public health sectors to formulate recommendations for optimizing preparedness protocols. Timeliness of referred patients with suspected EVD was used as indicator for preparedness. DESIGN: In focus group sessions and semistructured interviews, experiences of curative and public health stakeholders about the regional and national process of preparedness and response were listed. Timeliness recordings of all referred patients with suspected EVD (13) were collected from first date of illness until arrival in the referral academic hospital. RESULTS: Ebola preparedness was considered extensive compared with the risk of an actual patient, however necessary. Regional coordination varied between regions. More standardization of regional preparation and operational guidelines was requested, as well as nationally standardized contingency criteria, and the National Centre for Infectious Disease Control was expected to coordinate the development of these guidelines. For the timeliness of referred patients with suspected EVD, the median delay between first date of illness until triage was 2.0 days (range: 0-10 days), and between triage and arrival in the referral hospital, it was 5.0 hours (range: 2-7.5 hours). In none of these patients Ebola infection was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: Coordination between the public health sector and the curative sector needs improvement to reduce delay in patient management in emerging infectious diseases. Standardization of preparedness and response practices, through guidelines for institutional preparedness and blueprints for regional and national coordination, is necessary, as preparedness for emerging infectious diseases needs a multidisciplinary approach overarching both the public health sector and the curative sector. In the Netherlands a national platform for preparedness is established, in which both the curative sector and public health sector participate, in order to implement the outcomes of this study.\n",

      "Rationale: HSV is one of the most widespread human viral pathogens. HSV-1 infects a large portion of the human population and causes severe diseases. The current clinical treatment for HSV-1 is based on nucleoside analogues, the use of which is limited due to drug resistance, side effects and poor bioavailability. AMPs have been identified as potential antiviral agents that may overcome these limitations. Therefore, we screened anti-HSV-1 peptides from a scorpion-derived AMP library and engineered one candidate into a histidine-rich peptide with significantly improved antiviral activity and development potential. Methods: A venomous gland cDNA library was constructed from the scorpion Euscorpiops validus in the Yunnan Province of China. Six putative AMPs were characterized from this cDNA library, and the synthesized peptides were screened via plaque-forming assays to determine their virucidal potential. Time of addition experiments according to the infection progress of HSV-1 were used to identify the modes of action for peptides of interest. The histidine-rich modification was designed based on structural analysis of peptides by a helical wheel model and CD spectroscopy. Peptide cellular uptake and distribution were measured by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, respectively. Results: The peptide Eval418 was found to have high clearance activity in an HSV-1 plaque reduction assay. Eval418 exhibited dose-dependent and time-dependent inactivation of HSV-1 and dose-dependent inhibition of HSV-1 attachment to host cells. However, Eval418 scarcely suppressed an established HSV-1 infection due to poor cellular uptake. We further designed and modified Eval418 into four histidine-rich derivative peptides with enhanced antiviral activities and lower cytotoxicities. All of the derivative peptides suppressed established HSV-1 infections. One of these peptides, Eval418-FH5, not only had strong viral inactivation activity and enhanced attachment inhibitory activity but also had high inhibitory activity against intracellular HSV-1, which was consistent with its improved intracellular uptake and distribution as confirmed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Conclusion: We successfully identified an anti-HSV-1 peptide, Eval418, from a scorpion venom peptide library and designed a histidine-rich Eval418 derivative with significantly improved potential for further development as an anti-HSV-1 drug. This successful modification can provide a design strategy to improve the bioavailability, cellular distribution and antiviral activity of peptide agents.\n",

      "Rationale: Cardiac stem cell-derived exosomes have been demonstrated to promote cardiac regeneration following myocardial infarction in preclinical studies. Recent studies have used intramyocardial injection in order to concentrate exosomes in the infarct. Though effective in a research setting, this method is not clinically appealing due to its invasive nature. We propose the use of a targeting peptide, cardiac homing peptide (CHP), to target intravenously-infused exosomes to the infarcted heart. Methods: Exosomes were conjugated with CHP through a DOPE-NHS linker. Ex vivo targeting was analyzed by incubating organ sections with the CHP exosomes and analyzing with fluorescence microscopy. In vitro assays were performed on neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and H9C2 cells. For the animal study, we utilized an ischemia/reperfusion rat model. Animals were treated with either saline, scramble peptide exosomes, or CHP exosomes 24 h after surgery. Echocardiography was performed 4 h after surgery and 21 d after surgery. At 21 d, animals were sacrificed, and organs were collected for analysis. Results: By conjugating the exosomes with CHP, we demonstrate increased retention of the exosomes within heart sections ex vivo and in vitro with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. In vitro studies showed improved viability, reduced apoptosis and increased exosome uptake when using CHP-XOs. Using an animal model of ischemia/reperfusion injury, we measured the heart function, infarct size, cellular proliferation, and angiogenesis, with improved outcomes with the CHP exosomes. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate a novel method for increasing delivery of for treatment of myocardial infarction. By targeting exosomes to the infarcted heart, there was a significant improvement in outcomes with reduced fibrosis and scar size, and increased cellular proliferation and angiogenesis.\n",

Objective: To summarize the current knowledge on pharmacological activities, mechanisms and applications of extracts and saikosaponins isolated from Radix Bupleuri, and obtain new insights for further research and development of Radix Bupleuri. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, Research Gate, Academic Journals and Google Scholar were used as information sources through the inclusion of the search terms ‘Radix Bupleuri’, ‘Bupleurum’, ‘saikosaponins’, ‘Radix Bupleuri preparation’, and their combinations, mainly from the year 2008 to 2016 without language restriction. Clinical preparations containing Radix Bupleuri were collected from official website of China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA). Results and conclusion: 296 papers were searched and 128 papers were reviewed. A broad spectrum of in vitro and in vivo research has proved that Radix Bupleuri extracts, saikosaponin a, saikosaponin d, saikosaponin c, and saikosaponin b(2), exhibit evident anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antiviral, anti-allergic, immunoregulation, and neuroregulation activities mainly through NF-κB, MAPK or other pathways. 15 clinical preparations approved by CFDA remarkably broaden the application of Radix Bupleuri. The main side effect of Radix Bupleuri is liver damage when the dosage is excess, which indicates that the maximum tolerated dose is critical for clinical use of Radix Bupleuri extract and purified compounds.\n",

Objectives: Due to the lack of pharmacological studies on this herbal medicine, we explored the inhibitory activity of torilidis fructus on the macrophage-mediated inflammatory response using its ethanol extract (Tf-EE). Material and methods: The Griess assay and prostaglandin (PGE(2)) ELISA assay were conducted with Tf-EE (0-75 µg/mL) and LPS (1 µg/mL) treated RAW264.7 cells in cultured media. Tf-EE pretreated RAW264.7 cells were incubated with LPS for 6 h and semi-quantitative PCR was performed. Reporter gene assays, overexpression of target enzymes and immunoblotting were performed on macrophages to determine the molecular targets of Tf-EE. Results: Tf-EE markedly suppressed the inflammatory response of macrophages, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) and PGE(2) production with IC(50) values of 35.66 and 62.47 µg/mL, respectively. It was also found that Tf-EE reduced the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 by 80%. Nuclear translocation and activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB (p65 and p50) were declined by 60% and 30% respectively, and their regulatory events including the phosphorylation of AKT, IκBα, Src, and the formation of complexes between Src and p-p85 were also recognized to be diminished. Conclusions: The signalling events managed by Src and p85 complex seemed to be critically involved in Tf-EE-mediated anti-inflammatory response. This might suggest that Tf-EE exhibited anti-inflammatory effects through Src-targeted inhibition of NF-κB.\n",

      "MOTIVATION: To understand protein structure, folding and function fully and to design proteins de novo reliably, we must learn from natural protein structures that have been characterized experimentally. The number of protein structures available is large and growing exponentially, which makes this task challenging. Indeed, computational resources are becoming increasingly important for classifying and analyzing this resource. Here, we use tools from graph theory to define an Atlas classification scheme for automatically categorizing certain protein substructures. RESULTS: Focusing on the α-helical coiled coils, which are ubiquitous protein-structure and protein–protein interaction motifs, we present a suite of computational resources designed for analyzing these assemblies. iSOCKET enables interactive analysis of side-chain packing within proteins to identify coiled coils automatically and with considerable user control. Applying a graph theory-based Atlas classification scheme to structures identified by iSOCKET gives the Atlas of Coiled Coils, a fully automated, updated overview of extant coiled coils. The utility of this approach is illustrated with the first formal classification of an emerging subclass of coiled coils called α-helical barrels. Furthermore, in the Atlas, the known coiled-coil universe is presented alongside a partial enumeration of the ‘dark matter’ of coiled-coil structures; i.e. those coiled-coil architectures that are theoretically possible but have not been observed to date, and thus present defined targets for protein design. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: iSOCKET is available as part of the open-source GitHub repository associated with this work (https://github.com/woolfson-group/isocket). This repository also contains all the data generated when classifying the protein graphs. The Atlas of Coiled Coils is available at: http://coiledcoils.chm.bris.ac.uk/atlas/app.\n",

      "RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate (imatinib) is a classic tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia. Although it is well tolerated by most patients and helps in the achievement of complete remission, a few rare imatinib-associated adverse effects such as pulmonary interstitial fibrosis have been reported. Because of its rareity, the clinical features of imatinib-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD) remain unclear. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 49-year-old Chinese man with chronic myeloid leukemia received oral treatment with imatinib and initially exhibited a good response. However, he presented with cough and fever 9 months after treatment initiation. DIAGNOSES: Pulmonary computed tomography indicated diffuse interstitial fibrosis in both lungs. All tests for possible infectious pathologies provided negative results. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia and treated with antibiotics; however, there was no improvement. On the basis of a suspicion of imatinib-induced ILD, imatinib was discontinued and prednisone treatment was initiated. OUTCOMES: The patient's symptoms ameliorated with treatment, and imatinib was reintroduced. However, he developed cough and dyspnea again, and his treatment was switched to nilotinib as a second-line regimen. He was regularly monitored, and although his clinical symptoms ameliorated, computed tomography performed 29 months after he was diagnosed with ILD showed irreversible pulmonary interstitial fibrosis without progression. LESSONS: Clinicians should consider the possibility of severe irreversible ILD and carefully monitor patients receiving imatinib treatment.\n",

      "RATIONALE: Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) is an uncommon type of acute lung injury associated with infection, connective tissue disorders, drug exposure, and hematologic malignancies. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 53-year-old female presented with intermittent fever, chills, and dry cough since 10 days. Chest computed tomography scan showed multiple bilateral patchy infiltrates. PPD skin test was positive but tuberculosis antibody test and T-SPOT were negative. DIAGNOSES: Histologic examination revealed massive fibrinous exudation with organization within alveolar spaces and scattered neutrophilic infiltrates, which was consistent with AFOP. INTERVENTIONS: This patient was treated with prednisolone therapy. OUTCOMES: Chest radiograph improvement and symptom improvement, including fever and respiratory symptoms, was observed after 2 week of oral prednisolone treatment. After 9-month of treatment, the patient was asymptomatic with stable disease and improved quality of life. LESSONS: AFOP has unique pathologic manifestations; however, the condition is liable to be misdiagnosed as community-acquired pneumonia ortuberculosis. Antibiotics are ineffective, while some patients show good response to glucocorticoid therapy.\n",

      "RATIONALE: Pneumocystis jirovecii causes severe pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts. Human immunodeficiency virus infection, malignancy, solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplantation, and primary immune deficiency compose the risk factors for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in children, and PCP can be an initial clinical manifestation of primary immune deficiency. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 5-month-old infant presented with cyanosis and tachypnea. He had no previous medical or birth history suggesting primary immune deficiency. He was diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia on admission. DIAGNOSES: He was diagnosed with PCP, and further evaluations revealed underlying X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: He was treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for PCP, and eventually received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for hyper-IgM syndrome. OUTCOMES: Twenty months have passed after transplantation without severe complications. LESSONS: PCP should be considered in infants presenting with severe interstitial pneumonia even in the absence of evidence of immune deficiency. Primary immune deficiency should also be suspected in infants diagnosed with PCP.\n",

      "RATIONALE: Asthma exacerbations often occur due to infectious triggers, but determining whether infection is present and whether it is bacterial or viral remains clinically challenging. A diagnostic strategy that clarifies these uncertainties could enable personalized asthma treatment and mitigate antibiotic overuse. OBJECTIVES: To explore the performance of validated peripheral blood gene expression signatures in discriminating bacterial, viral, and noninfectious triggers in subjects with asthma exacerbations. METHODS: Subjects with suspected asthma exacerbations of various etiologies were retrospectively selected for peripheral blood gene expression analysis from a pool of subjects previously enrolled in emergency departments with acute respiratory illness. RT-PCR quantified 87 gene targets, selected from microarray-based studies, followed by logistic regression modeling to define bacterial, viral, or noninfectious class. The model-predicted class was compared to clinical adjudication and procalcitonin. RESULTS: Of 46 subjects enrolled, 7 were clinically adjudicated as bacterial, 18 as viral, and 21 as noninfectious. Model prediction was congruent with clinical adjudication in 15/18 viral and 13/21 noninfectious cases, but only 1/7 bacterial cases. None of the adjudicated bacterial cases had confirmatory microbiology; the precise etiology in this group was uncertain. Procalcitonin classified only one subject in the cohort as bacterial. 47.8% of subjects received antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Our model classified asthma exacerbations by the underlying bacterial, viral, and noninfectious host response. Compared to clinical adjudication, the majority of discordances occurred in the bacterial group, due to either imperfect adjudication or model misclassification. Bacterial infection was identified infrequently by all classification schemes, but nearly half of subjects were prescribed antibiotics. A gene expression-based approach may offer useful diagnostic information in this population and guide appropriate antibiotic use.\n",

      "Context: Coptidis rhizome (CR), also known as Huanglian in Chinese, is the rhizome of Coptis chinensis Franch., C. deltoidea C.Y. Cheng et Hsiao, or C. teeta Wall (Ranunculaceae). It has been widely used to treat bacillary dysentery, diabetes, pertussis, sore throat, aphtha, and eczema in China. Objectives: The present paper reviews the latest advances of CR, focusing on the botany, phytochemistry, traditional usages, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and toxicology of CR and its future perspectives. Methods: Studies from 1985 to 2018 were reviewed from books; PhD. and MSc. dissertations; the state and local drug standards; PubMed; CNKI; Scopus; the Web of Science; and Google Scholar using the keywords Coptis, Coptidis Rhizoma, Huanglian, and goldthread. Results: Currently, 128 chemical constituents have been isolated and identified from CR. Alkaloids are the characteristic components, together with organic acids, coumarins, phenylpropanoids and quinones. The extracts/compounds isolated from CR cover a wide pharmacological spectrum, including antibacterial, antivirus, antifungal, antidiabetic, anticancer and cardioprotective effects. Berberine is the most important active constituent and the primary toxic component of CR. Conclusions: As an important herbal medicine in Chinese medicine, CR has the potential to treat various diseases. However, further research should be undertaken to investigate the clinical effects, toxic constituents, target organs and pharmacokinetics, and to establish criteria for quality control, for CR and its related medications. In addition, the active constituents, other than alkaloids, in both raw and processed products of CR should be investigated.\n",

      "PROBLEM: Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infection has been shown to increase sexual transmission of HIV‐1. However, the mechanism of NG‐induced enhanced HIV‐1 transmission is unknown. METHODS: (a) The cervical tissues were exposed to NG, and cytokine induction was monitored by measuring cytokine proteins in culture supernatants and cytokine mRNAs in tissues. (b) Transcription and replication of HIV‐1 in TZM‐bl, U1, and ACH2 cells were measured by Beta‐Gal activity and p24 proteins in the supernatant, respectively. (c) HIV‐1 transmission was assayed in an organ culture system by measuring transmitted HIV‐1 in supernatant and HIV‐1 gag mRNA in the tissues. (d) Transcriptome analysis was done using second generation sequencing. RESULTS: (a) NG induced membrane ruffling of epithelial layer, caused migration of CD3+ cells to the intraepithelial region, and induced high levels of inflammatory cytokines IL‐1β and TNF‐α. (b) NG‐induced supernatants (NGIS) increased HIV‐1 transcription, induced HIV‐1 from latently infected cells, and increased transmission of HIV‐1 across cervical mucosa. (c) Transcriptome analysis of the epithelial layer of the tissues exposed to NG, and HIV‐1 showed significant upregulation of CXCL10 and IL8. IL‐1β increased the induction of CXCL10 and IL‐8 expression in cervical mucosa with a concomitant increase in HIV‐1 transmission. CONCLUSION: We present a model in which IL‐1β produced from cervical epithelium during NG exposure increases CXCL10 and IL8 in epithelia. This in turn causes upon HIV‐1 infection, the migration of HIV‐1 target cells toward the subepithelium, resulting in increased HIV‐1 transcription in the sub‐mucosa and subsequent enhancement of transmission across cervical mucosa.\n",

      "RATIONALE: Denatonium benzoate is a useful indicator to ensure that the respirator being used by an individual forms a tight enough seal to adequately protect against unwanted airborne exposure. Although the relative risk for adverse effects of fit testing using denatonium benzoate is low, the absolute number of workers with adverse reactions may nevertheless be sizeable. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 34-year-old female nurse rapidly developed shortness of breath, cough, and agitation after denatonium benzoate fit testing. She had a history of allergy to shrimp, crab, mite, and disinfecting products (containing quaternary ammonium). DIAGNOSES: Due to typical symptoms of asthma after exposure to denatonium benzoate aerosol without any other apparent cause, serial pulmonary function tests indicating obstructive lung function and a higher concentration of immunoglobulin antibody E, she was diagnosed with allergic asthma. INTERVENTIONS: This patient was treated with omalizumab (Xolair), corticosteroid, β(2) agonist, montelukast, and Symbicort turbuhaler. OUTCOMES: The patient showed quick responses after treatment with diphenhydramine (intramuscularly), fenoterol HBr (inhalation), and prednisolone (oral). Approximately 2 weeks later, she suffered from difficulty breathing and asthmatic symptoms again when she was exposed to polished wax and disinfectant. She was treated with omalizumab (Xolair), corticosteroid, β(2) agonist, montelukast, and Symbicort turbuhaler. The patient was in stable condition with improvement in symptoms during follow-up. LESSONS: There may be potentially important health risks when healthcare workers are exposed to denatonium benzoate. Individuals who have a history of allergy to disinfecting products (containing quaternary ammonium) should avoid exposure of denatonium benzoate. More advanced research is needed in the future.\n",

      "Rationale: In the context of rapid antiretroviral therapy rollout and an increasing burden of noncommunicable diseases, there are few contemporary data describing the etiology and outcome of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in sub-Saharan Africa. Objectives: To describe the current etiology of CAP in Malawi and identify risk factors for mortality. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of adults hospitalized with CAP to a teaching hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Etiology was defined by blood culture, Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen detection, sputum mycobacterial culture and Xpert MTB/RIF, and nasopharyngeal aspirate multiplex PCR. Measurements and Main Results: In 459 patients (285 [62.1%] males; median age, 34.7 [interquartile range, 29.4–41.9] yr), 30-day mortality was 14.6% (64/439) and associated with male sex (adjusted odds ratio, 2.60 [95% confidence interval, 1.17–5.78]), symptom duration greater than 7 days (2.78 [1.40–5.54]), tachycardia (2.99 [1.48–6.06]), hypoxemia (4.40 [2.03–9.51]), and inability to stand (3.59 [1.72–7.50]). HIV was common (355/453; 78.4%), frequently newly diagnosed (124/355; 34.9%), but not associated with mortality. S. pneumoniae (98/458; 21.4%) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (75/326; 23.0%) were the most frequently identified pathogens. Viral infection occurred in 32.6% (148/454) with influenza (40/454; 8.8%) most common. Bacterial–viral coinfection occurred in 9.1% (28/307). Detection of M. tuberculosis was associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 2.44 [1.19–5.01]). Conclusions: In the antiretroviral therapy era, CAP in Malawi remains predominantly HIV associated, with a large proportion attributable to potentially vaccine-preventable pathogens. Strategies to increase early detection and treatment of tuberculosis and improve supportive care, in particular the correction of hypoxemia, should be evaluated in clinical trials to address CAP-associated mortality.\n",

      "Context: Morphine is an alkaloid isolated from the poppy plants. The addiction of morphine is a very serious social issue. Some long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proposed to engage in drug addiction. Objective: Whether lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) attended to morphine-mediated autophagy of mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells was probed. Materials and methods: HT22 cells were subjected to 10 µM morphine for 24 h. Cell autophagy was assessed by measuring LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1 expression. qRT-PCR was carried out to measure MEG3 expression. SiRNA oligoribonucleotides targeting MEG3 (si-MEG3) was transfected to silence MEG3. The orexin1 receptor (OX1R), c-fos, p/t-ERK and p/t-PKC expressions were tested by western blotting. SCH772984 was used as an inhibitor of ERK pathway. Results: Morphine elevated OX1R (2.92 times), c-fos (2.06 times), p/t-ERK (2.04 times) and p/t-PKC (2.4 times), Beclin-1 (3.2 times) and LC3-II/LC3-I (3.96 times) expression in HT22 cells. Moreover, followed by morphine exposure, the MEG3 expression was also elevated in HT22 cells (3.03 times). The silence of MEG3 lowered the Beclin-1 (1.85 times), LC3-II/LC3-I (2.12 times), c-fos (1.39 times) and p/t-ERK (1.44 times) expressions in morphine-treated HT22 cells. Inhibitor of ERK pathway SCH772984 further promoted the influence of MEG3 silence on morphine-caused Beclin-1 (1.97 times) and LC3-II/LC3-I (1.92 times) expressions decreases. Conclusions: Up-regulation of MEG3 attended to the morphine-caused autophagy of HT22 cells might be through elevating c-fos expression and promoting ERK pathway activation. More experiments are also needed in the future to analyse the influence of other lncRNAs in drug addiction.\n",

      "Methods: Ciliated epithelial samples were obtained from 76 children and adult volunteers aged 6 months to 43 years by brushing the inferior nasal turbinate. Beating cilia were recorded using a digital high speed video camera which allowed analysis of ciliary beat pattern and beat frequency. Tissue was fixed for transmission electron microscopy. Results: The mean ciliary beat frequency for the paediatric population (12.8 Hz (95% CI 12.3 to 13.3)) was higher than for the adult group (11.5 Hz (95% CI 10.3 to 12.7 Hz), p<0.01, t test); 10% (range 6–24%) of ciliated edges were found to have areas of dyskinetically beating cilia. All samples had evidence of mild epithelial damage. This reflected changes found in all measurements used for assessment of epithelial damage. Ciliary ultrastructural defects were found in less than 5% of cilia. Conclusion: Normal age related reference ranges have been established for ciliary structure and beat frequency. In a healthy population localised epithelial damage may be present causing areas of ciliary dyskinesia.\n",

      "Significance: The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the normal control of cardiovascular and renal function in the healthy state and is a contributing factor in the development and progression of various types of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including hypertension, diabetes, and heart failure. Recent Advances: Evidence suggests that a balance between activation of the ACE/Ang II/AT1 receptor axis and the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas receptor axis is important for the function of the heart, kidney, and autonomic nervous system control of the circulation in the normal healthy state. An imbalance in these opposing pathways toward the ACE/Ang II/AT1 receptor axis is associated with CVD. The key component of this imbalance with respect to neural control of the circulation is the negative interaction between oxidative and NO(•) mechanisms, which leads to enhanced sympathetic tone and activation in disease conditions such as hypertension and heart failure. Critical Issues: The key mechanisms that disrupt normal regulation of Ang II and Ang-(1–7) signaling and promote pathogenesis of CVD at all organ levels remain poorly understood. The reciprocal relation between ACE and ACE2 expression and function suggests they are controlled interdependently at pre- and post-translational levels. Insights from neural studies suggest that an interaction between oxidative and nitrosative pathways may be key. Future Directions: The role of redox mechanisms in the control of expression and activity of RAS enzymes and Ang receptors may provide important insight into the function of local tissue RAS in health and disease.

      "CONTEXT: Over the past decade, a number of high-impact natural hazard events, together with the increased recognition of pandemic risks, have intensified interest in health systems’ ability to prepare for, and cope with, “surges” (sudden large-scale escalations) in treatment needs. In this article, we identify key concepts and components associated with this emerging research theme. We consider the requirements for a standardized conceptual framework for future research capable of informing policy to reduce the morbidity and mortality impacts of such incidents. Here our objective is to appraise the consistency and utility of existing conceptualizations of health systems’ surge capacity and their components, with a view to standardizing concepts and measurements to enable future research to generate a cumulative knowledge base for policy and practice. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature on concepts of health systems’ surge capacity, with a narrative summary of key concepts relevant to public health. FINDINGS: The academic literature on surge capacity demonstrates considerable variation in its conceptualization, terms, definitions, and applications. This, together with an absence of detailed and comparable data, has hampered efforts to develop standardized conceptual models, measurements, and metrics. Some degree of consensus is evident for the components of surge capacity, but more work is needed to integrate them. The overwhelming concentration in the United States complicates the generalizability of existing approaches and findings. CONCLUSIONS: The concept of surge capacity is a useful addition to the study of health systems’ disaster and/or pandemic planning, mitigation, and response, and it has far-reaching policy implications. Even though research in this area has grown quickly, it has yet to fulfill its potential to generate knowledge to inform policy. Work is needed to generate robust conceptual and analytical frameworks, along with innovations in data collection and methodological approaches that enhance health systems’ readiness for, and response to, unpredictable high-consequence surges in demand.\n",

      "RATIONALE: Over-activity of the brain Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) is a major contributor to neurogenic hypertension. While over-expression of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme type 2 (ACE2) has been shown to be beneficial in reducing hypertension by transforming Angiotensin (Ang)-II into Ang-(1-7), several groups have reported decreased brain ACE2 expression and activity during the development of hypertension. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding results in decreased membrane-bound ACE2 in the brain, thus promoting the development of neurogenic hypertension. METHODS AND RESULTS: To test this hypothesis, we used the DOCA-salt model of neurogenic hypertension in non-transgenic (NT) and syn-hACE2 mice over-expressing ACE2 in neurons. DOCA-salt treatment in NT mice led to significant increases in blood pressure, hypothalamic Ang-II levels, inflammation, impaired baroreflex sensitivity, autonomic dysfunction, as well as decreased hypothalamic ACE2 activity and expression, while these changes were blunted or prevented in syn-hACE2 mice. In addition, reduction of ACE2 expression and activity in the brain paralleled a rise in ACE2 activity in the cerebrospinal fluid of NT mice following DOCA-salt treatment and was accompanied by enhanced ADAM17 expression and activity in the hypothalamus. Chronic knockdown of ADAM17 in the brain blunted the development of hypertension and restored ACE2 activity and baroreflex function. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide the first evidence that ADAM17-mediated shedding impairs brain ACE2 compensatory activity, thus contributing to the development of neurogenic hypertension.\n",

      "CONTEXT: There have been few longitudinal studies of cytokine production in neonatally acquired HIV-1 infection and none in Asian or Chinese children. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether monitoring cytokine production could contribute to the better management of pediatric patients with HIV-1 infection. SETTING: Clinical Immunology Laboratory and Pediatrics Department, University Hospital, Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Ten Asian and 2 Eurasian children infected with HIV-1 by mother-to-child transmission were followed for up to 5 years while on treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Numbers of unstimulated and mitogen-activated cytokine-secreting cells (IFN-gamma, interleukin [IL]-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-alpha) were measured by ELISPOT assay at frequent intervals, and correlations were sought with CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts and viral loads. RESULTS: Mitogen-stimulated IL-2-secreting cells were directly associated with recovery of CD4+ cells. Correlations with viral load were found for Con A-induced IFN-gamma, Con A-induced IL-4, and unstimulated IL-10, suggesting that these cytokines were either suppressed by high virus levels or that higher cytokine levels suppressed virus. IFN-gamma, IL-2-, IL-4-, and IL-12-secreting cells induced by PHA, Con A, and/or SAC tended to increase for the first 3–4 years of treatment but declined thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in cytokine profiles were not associated with adverse clinical events and there was little evidence to indicate that monitoring cytokine enzyme-linked immunospots (ELISPOTs) could contribute to pediatric patient management. INTRODUCTION: With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be controlled for prolonged periods,[1] although the virus cannot be eliminated[2] and treatment failures occur due to development of drug-resistant mutations.[3] Chronic immune hyperactivation and raised T-cell turnover due to continued viral replication and antigenic stimulation are present even after HAART has decreased the viral load to undetectable levels.[4] Both proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines are produced during chronic immune stimulation. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), contribute to tissue pathology, especially in the brain,[5] and can induce transcription of latent HIV-1.[6,7] Type 2 or regulatory cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10, can suppress type 1 cytokines and induce polyclonal B-cell activation,[8] lymphomagenesis,[9] autoantibody production,[10] and manifestations of allergy.[11] Type 1 cytokines, such as IL-12, interferon (IFN) gamma, and IL-2, are important for antiviral cell-mediated immunity.[12] During the long course of HIV-1 infection, type 2 cytokines gradually come to predominate over type 1 cytokines,[13–16] although this finding is not universally accepted.[17] There have been few studies of in vitro cytokine production in neonatally acquired HIV-1 infection in Asian or Chinese children. The enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) system for measuring unstimulated or mitogen-activated cytokine secreting cells has not been evaluated in this context. We wished to know whether monitoring cytokine production in addition to CD4+ cell counts and viral load could provide additional useful information in pediatric patients with HIV-1 infection being treated with HAART. We hoped to identify cytokine profiles that are characteristic of either clinical improvement or disease progression, so that manipulation towards the desirable profile might be attempted.\n",

      "Rationale: Respiratory viral infections can result in the establishment of chronic lung diseases. Understanding the early innate immune mechanisms that participate in the development of chronic postviral lung disease may reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention. The intracellular viral sensor protein melanoma differentiation–associated protein 5 (MDA5) sustains the acute immune response to Sendai virus, a mouse pathogen that causes chronic lung inflammation, but its role in the development of postviral chronic lung disease is unknown. Objectives: To establish the role of MDA5 in the development of chronic lung disease. Methods: MDA5-deficient or control mice were infected with Sendai virus. The acute inflammatory response was evaluated by profiling chemokine and cytokine expression and by characterizing the composition of the cellular infiltrate. The impact of MDA5 on chronic lung pathology and function was evaluated through histological studies, degree of oxygen saturation, and responsiveness to carbachol. Measurements and Main Results: MDA5 deficiency resulted in normal virus replication and in a distinct profile of chemokines and cytokines that associated with acute lung neutropenia and enhanced accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages. Diminished expression of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines was also observed in cells infected with influenza virus, suggesting a key role of MDA5 in driving the early accumulation of neutrophils at the infection site. The biased acute inflammatory response of MDA5-deficient mice led to an enhanced chronic lung inflammation, epithelial cell hyperplasia, airway hyperreactivity, and diminished blood oxygen saturation. Conclusions: MDA5 modulates the development of chronic lung inflammation by regulating the early inflammatory response in the lung.\n",

      "Rationale: Classical interpretation of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease pathogenesis suggests that infection initiates disease progression, leading to an exuberant inflammatory response, excessive mucus, and ultimately bronchiectasis. Although symptomatic antibiotic treatment controls lung infections early in disease, lifelong bacterial residence typically ensues. Processes that control the establishment of persistent bacteria in the CF lung, and the contribution of noninfectious components to disease pathogenesis, are poorly understood. Objectives: To evaluate whether continuous antibiotic therapy protects the CF lung from disease using a ferret model that rapidly acquires lethal bacterial lung infections in the absence of antibiotics. Methods: CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator)–knockout ferrets were treated with three antibiotics from birth to several years of age and lung disease was followed by quantitative computed tomography, BAL, and histopathology. Lung disease was compared with CFTR-knockout ferrets treated symptomatically with antibiotics. Measurements and Main Results: Bronchiectasis was quantified from computed tomography images. BAL was evaluated for cellular differential and features of inflammatory cellular activation, bacteria, fungi, and quantitative proteomics. Semiquantitative histopathology was compared across experimental groups. We demonstrate that lifelong antibiotics can protect the CF ferret lung from infections for several years. Surprisingly, CF animals still developed hallmarks of structural bronchiectasis, neutrophil-mediated inflammation, and mucus accumulation, despite the lack of infection. Quantitative proteomics of BAL from CF and non-CF pairs demonstrated a mucoinflammatory signature in the CF lung dominated by Muc5B and neutrophil chemoattractants and products. Conclusions: These findings implicate mucoinflammatory processes in the CF lung as pathogenic in the absence of clinically apparent bacterial and fungal infections.\n",

      "Rationale: The ARDS Network (ARDSNet) used a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)/Fi(O(2)) model in many studies. In general, pediatric intensivists use less PEEP and higher Fi(O(2)) than this model. Objectives: To evaluate whether children managed with PEEP lower than recommended by the ARDSNet PEEP/Fi(O(2)) model had higher mortality. Methods: This was a multicenter, retrospective analysis of patients with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) managed without a formal PEEP/Fi(O(2)) protocol. Four distinct datasets were combined for analysis. We extracted time-matched PEEP/Fi(O(2)) values, calculating the difference between PEEP level and the ARDSNet-recommended PEEP level for a given Fi(O(2)). We analyzed the median difference over the first 24 hours of PARDS diagnosis against ICU mortality and adjusted for confounding variables, effect modifiers, or factors that may have affected the propensity to use lower PEEP. Measurements and Main Results: Of the 1,134 patients with PARDS, 26.6% were managed with lower PEEP relative to the amount of Fi(O(2)) recommended by the ARDSNet protocol. Patients managed with lower PEEP experienced higher mortality than those who were managed with PEEP levels in line with or higher than recommended by the protocol (P < 0.001). After adjustment for hypoxemia, inotropes, comorbidities, severity of illness, ventilator settings, nitric oxide, and dataset, PEEP lower than recommended by the protocol remained independently associated with higher mortality (odds ratio, 2.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.32–3.17). Findings were similar after propensity-based covariate adjustment (odds ratio, 2.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.24–3.22). Conclusions: Patients with PARDS managed with lower PEEP relative to Fi(O(2)) than recommended by the ARDSNet model had higher mortality. Clinical trials targeting PEEP management in PARDS are needed.\n",

      "Rationale: After lung transplantation, insults to the allograft generally result in one of four histopathologic patterns of injury: (1) acute rejection, (2) lymphocytic bronchiolitis, (3) organizing pneumonia, and (4) diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). We hypothesized that DAD, the most severe form of acute lung injury, would lead to the highest risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and that a type I immune response would mediate this process. Objectives: Determine whether DAD is associated with CLAD and explore the potential role of CXCR3/ligand biology. Methods: Transbronchial biopsies from all lung transplant recipients were reviewed. The association between the four injury patterns and subsequent outcomes were evaluated using proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) concentrations of the CXCR3 ligands (CXCL9/MIG, CXCL10/IP10, and CXCL11/ITAC) were compared between allograft injury patterns and “healthy” biopsies using linear mixed-effects models. The effect of these chemokine alterations on CLAD risk was assessed using Cox models with serial BAL measurements as time-dependent covariates. Measurements and Main Results: There were 1,585 biopsies from 441 recipients with 62 episodes of DAD. An episode of DAD was associated with increased risk of CLAD (hazard ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.9–4.7) and death (hazard ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.7–3.0). There were marked elevations in BAL CXCR3 ligand concentrations during DAD. Furthermore, prolonged elevation of these chemokines in serial BAL fluid measurements predicted the development of CLAD. Conclusions: DAD is associated with marked increases in the risk of CLAD and death after lung transplantation. This association may be mediated in part by an aberrant type I immune response involving CXCR3/ligands.\n",

      "Methods: Intrapulmonary artery (PA) segments were obtained from White Landrace pigs (25–35 kg) and incubated with LPS, IL-1α, and TNF-α and O(2)(• -) release was measured by the superoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c. The source of O(2)(• -) formation was determined using a number of enzyme inhibitors. The role of NO was explored using NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors and the distribution of NOS isoforms and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-), an index of NO–O(2)(• -) interactions) assessed by immunocytochemistry. Results: LPS, IL-1α, and TNF-α promoted the formation of O(2)(• -) from PA compared with untreated controls in a time and dose dependent manner, an effect markedly enhanced by removal of the endothelium but completely inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium chloride (DPI). L-NAME and the eNOS inhibitor N(5)-(1-iminoethyl)-ornithine (L-NIO) enhanced O(2)(• -) formation from PA (with endothelium) in response to IL-1α and TNF-α but had no effect on LPS mediated O(2)(• -) formation, whereas L-NAME and the iNOS inhibitor L-N(6)-(1-iminoethyl)-lysine-HCl (L-NIL) enhanced O(2)(• -) formation only in response to LPS. Conclusions: LPS, IL-1α, and TNF-α promote O(2)(• -) formation through an upregulation of NADPH oxidase activity which is augmented by removal of the endothelium, as well as the inhibition of eNOS (in the case of cytokines) and iNOS (in the case of LPS). The concomitant expression of NOS isoforms (and NO formation) with that of NADPH oxidase may therefore constitute a protective system designed to remove O(2)(• -) through the formation of ONOO(-). If this is so, the integrity of the endothelium may be axiomatic in the progression and severity of ARDS.\n",

      "Context: The exchange of health information on the Internet has been heralded as an opportunity to improve public health surveillance. In a field that has traditionally relied on an established system of mandatory and voluntary reporting of known infectious diseases by doctors and laboratories to governmental agencies, innovations in social media and so-called user-generated information could lead to faster recognition of cases of infectious disease. More direct access to such data could enable surveillance epidemiologists to detect potential public health threats such as rare, new diseases or early-level warnings for epidemics. But how useful are data from social media and the Internet, and what is the potential to enhance surveillance? The challenges of using these emerging surveillance systems for infectious disease epidemiology, including the specific resources needed, technical requirements, and acceptability to public health practitioners and policymakers, have wide-reaching implications for public health surveillance in the 21st century. Methods: This article divides public health surveillance into indicator-based surveillance and event-based surveillance and provides an overview of each. We did an exhaustive review of published articles indexed in the databases PubMed, Scopus, and Scirus between 1990 and 2011 covering contemporary event-based systems for infectious disease surveillance. Findings: Our literature review uncovered no event-based surveillance systems currently used in national surveillance programs. While much has been done to develop event-based surveillance, the existing systems have limitations. Accordingly, there is a need for further development of automated technologies that monitor health-related information on the Internet, especially to handle large amounts of data and to prevent information overload. The dissemination to health authorities of new information about health events is not always efficient and could be improved. No comprehensive evaluations show whether event-based surveillance systems have been integrated into actual epidemiological work during real-time health events. Conclusions: The acceptability of data from the Internet and social media as a regular part of public health surveillance programs varies and is related to a circular challenge: the willingness to integrate is rooted in a lack of effectiveness studies, yet such effectiveness can be proved only through a structured evaluation of integrated systems. Issues related to changing technical and social paradigms in both individual perceptions of and interactions with personal health data, as well as social media and other data from the Internet, must be further addressed before such information can be integrated into official surveillance systems.\n",

      "Rationale: Most virus-induced attacks of asthma are caused by rhinoviruses (RVs). Objectives: To determine whether people with asthma are susceptible to an increased viral load during RV infection. Methods: Seventy-four children (4–18 yr old) were enrolled; 28 with wheezing, 32 with acute rhinitis, and 14 without respiratory tract symptoms. Nasal washes were evaluated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction for RV to judge viral load along with gene sequencing to identify strains of RV. Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, IFN-λ(1), and eosinophil cationic protein in nasal washes, along with blood eosinophil counts and total and allergen-specific IgE in sera, were also evaluated. Similar assessments were done in 24 young adults (16 with asthma, 8 without) who participated in an experimental challenge with RV (serotype 16). Measurements and Main Results: Fifty-seven percent of wheezing children and 56% with acute rhinitis had nasal washes testing positive for RV. The geometric mean of viral loads by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in washes from wheezing children was 2.8-fold lower, but did not differ significantly from children with rhinitis (7,718 and 21,612 copies of viral RNA per microliter nasal wash, respectively; P = 0.48). The odds for wheezing were increased if children who tested positive for RV were sensitized to one or more allergens (odds ratio, 3.9; P = 0.02). Similarly, neither peak nor cumulative viral loads differed significantly in washes from adults with asthma compared with those without asthma during the experimental RV challenge. Conclusions: During acute symptoms, children infected with RV enrolled for wheezing or acute rhinitis had similar viral loads in their nasal washes, as did adults with and without asthma infected with RV-16 experimentally.\n",

      "Rationale: An activated vasoconstrictive, proliferative, and fibrotic axis of the renin angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE]/angiotensin [Ang]II/AngII type 1 receptor) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and pulmonary hypertension (PH). The recent discovery of a counterregulatory axis of the renin angiotensin system composed of ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas has led us to examine the role of this vasoprotective axis on such disorders. Objectives: We hypothesized that Ang-(1–7) treatment would exert protective effects against PF and PH. Methods: Lentiviral packaged Ang-(1–7) fusion gene or ACE2 cDNA was intratracheally administered into the lungs of male Sprague Dawley rats. Two weeks after gene transfer, animals received bleomycin (2.5 mg/kg). In a subsequent study, animals were administered monocrotaline (MCT, 50 mg/kg). Measurements and Main Results: In the PF study, bleomycin administration resulted in a significant increase in right ventricular systolic pressure, which was associated with the development of right ventricular hypertrophy. The lungs of these animals also exhibited excessive collagen deposition, decreased expression of ACE and ACE2, increased mRNA levels for transforming growth factor β and other proinflammatory cytokines, and increased protein levels of the AT(1)R. Overexpression of Ang-(1–7) significantly prevented all the above-mentioned pathophysiological conditions. Similar protective effects were also obtained with ACE2 overexpression. In the PH study, rats injected with MCT developed elevated right ventricular systolic pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular fibrosis, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, all of which were attenuated by Ang-(1–7) overexpression. Blockade of the Mas receptor abolished the beneficial effects of Ang-(1–7) against MCT-induced PH. Conclusions: Our observations demonstrate a cardiopulmonary protective role for the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas axis in the treatment of lung disorders.\n",

      "RATIONALE: Idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) is an unexplained obstruction involving the lower laryngeal and upper tracheal airway. Persistent mucosal inflammation is a hallmark of the disease. Epithelial microbiota dysbiosis is found in other chronic inflammatory mucosal diseases; however, the relationship between tracheal microbiota composition and iSGS is unknown. OBJECTIVES: Given the critical role for host defense at mucosal barriers, we analyzed tissue specimens from iSGS patients for the presence of microbial pathogens. METHODS: Utilizing 20 human iSGS, 20 intubation-related tracheal stenosis (iLTS) and 10 healthy control specimens we applied molecular, immunohistochemical, electron microscopic, immunologic and Sanger™ sequencing techniques. MAIN RESULTS: With unbiased culture-independent nucleic acid, protein, and immunologic approaches, we demonstrate that Mycobacterium species are uniquely associated with iSGS. Phylogenetic analysis of the mycobacterial virulence factor rpoB suggests that rather than Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (Mtb), a variant member of the Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Complex (MtbC), or a closely related novel mycobacterium is present in iSGS specimens. CONCLUSIONS: These studies identify a novel pathogenic role for established large airway bacteria, and provide new targets for future therapeutic intervention. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA.\n",

      "Rationale: Little is known about human club cells, dome-shaped cells with dense cytoplasmic granules and microvilli that represent the major secretory cells of the human small airways (at least sixth-generation bronchi). Objectives: To define the ontogeny and biology of the human small airway epithelium club cell. Methods: The small airway epithelium was sampled from the normal human lung by bronchoscopy and brushing. Single-cell transcriptome analysis and air–liquid interface culture were used to assess club cell ontogeny and biology. Measurements and Main Results: We identified the club cell population by unbiased clustering using single-cell transcriptome sequencing. Principal component gradient analysis uncovered an ontologic link between KRT5 (keratin 5)(+) basal cells and SCGB1A1 (secretoglobin family 1A member 1)(+) club cells, a hypothesis verified by demonstrating in vitro that a pure population of human KRT5(+) SCGB1A1(−) small airway epithelial basal cells differentiate into SCGB1A1(+)KRT5(−) club cells on air–liquid interface culture. Using SCGB1A1 as the marker of club cells, the single-cell analysis identified novel roles for these cells in host defense, xenobiotic metabolism, antiprotease, physical barrier function, monogenic lung disorders, and receptors for human viruses. Conclusions: These observations provide novel insights into the molecular phenotype and biologic functions of the human club cell population and identify basal cells as the human progenitor cells for club cells.\n",

      "Rationale: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive, uniformly fatal interstitial lung disease. An acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is an episode of acute respiratory worsening without an identifiable etiology. Occult viral infection has been proposed as a possible cause of acute exacerbation. Objectives: To use unbiased genomics-based discovery methods to define the role of viruses in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Methods: Bronchoalveolar lavage and serum from patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, stable disease, and acute lung injury were tested for viral nucleic acid using multiplex polymerase chain reaction, pan-viral microarray, and high-throughput cDNA sequencing. Measurements and Main Results: Four of forty-three patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis had evidence of common respiratory viral infection (parainfluenza [n = 1], rhinovirus [n = 2], coronavirus [n = 1]); no viruses were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage from stable patients. Pan-viral microarrays revealed additional evidence of viral infection (herpes simplex virus [n = 1], Epstein-Barr virus [n = 2], and torque teno virus [TTV] [n = 12]) in patients with acute exacerbation. TTV infection was significantly more common in patients with acute exacerbation than stable controls (P = 0.0003), but present in a similar percentage of acute lung injury controls. Deep sequencing of a subset of acute exacerbation cases confirmed the presence of TTV but did not identify additional viruses. Conclusions: Viral infection was not detected in most cases of acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. TTV was present in a significant minority of cases, and cases of acute lung injury; the clinical significance of this finding remains to be determined.\n",

      "Rationale: Patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after infection with severe respiratory viruses (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus, H5N1 avian influenza virus), exhibited unusually high levels of CXCL10, which belongs to the non-ELR (glutamic-leucine-arginine) CXC chemokine superfamily. CXCL10 may not be a bystander to the severe virus infection but may directly contribute to the pathogenesis of neutrophil-mediated, excessive pulmonary inflammation. Objectives: We investigated the contribution of CXCL10 and its receptor CXCR3 axis to the pathogenesis of ARDS with nonviral and viral origins. Methods: We induced nonviral ARDS by acid aspiration and viral ARDS by intratracheal influenza virus infection in wild-type mice and mice deficient in CXCL10, CXCR3, IFNAR1 (IFN-α/β receptor 1), or TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF). Measurements and Main Results: We found that the mice lacking CXCL10 or CXCR3 demonstrated improved severity and survival of nonviral and viral ARDS, whereas mice that lack IFNAR1 did not control the severity of ARDS in vivo. The increased levels of CXCL10 in lungs with ARDS originate to a large extent from infiltrated pulmonary neutrophils, which express a unique CXCR3 receptor via TRIF. CXCL10-CXCR3 acts in an autocrine fashion on the oxidative burst and chemotaxis in the inflamed neutrophils, leading to fulminant pulmonary inflammation. Conclusions: CXCL10-CXCR3 signaling appears to be a critical factor for the exacerbation of the pathology of ARDS. Thus, the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis could represent a prime therapeutic target in the treatment of the acute phase of ARDS of nonviral and viral origins.\n",

      "Rationale: Viral infections of the upper respiratory tract may influence the commensal nasopharyngeal bacteria. Changes in the bacterial niche could affect transmission dynamics. Attenuated vaccine viruses can be used to investigate this empirically in humans. Objectives: To study the effects of mild viral upper respiratory infections on nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization using live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) as a surrogate. Methods: We used trivalent LAIV to evaluate the effects of viral infection on bacterial carriage and density of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 151 healthy children were randomized 1:1 to receive the vaccine starting either at recruitment (n = 74) or 28 days later (n = 77) in a stepped wedge fashion, allowing comparisons between recipients and nonrecipients as well as whole-group comparisons pre- and postvaccination. Bacterial carriage and density were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 151 children were recruited, 77 in the LAIV group and 74 in the control group. LAIV recipients (n = 63 analyzed) showed an apparent transient increase in H. influenzae carriage but no further significant differences in carriage prevalence of the four bacterial species compared with controls (n = 72 analyzed). S. pneumoniae density was substantially higher in vaccine recipients (16,687 vs. 1935 gene copies per milliliter) 28 days after the first dose (P < 0.001). Whole-group multivariable analysis (prevaccine, after one dose, and after two doses) also showed increases in density of other species and H. influenzae carriage prevalence. Conclusions: In the absence of any safety signals despite widespread use of the vaccine, these findings suggest that bacterial density, and thus transmission rates among children and to people in other age groups, may rise following attenuated influenza infections without associated clinical disease. LAIV could therefore be used as an experimental tool to elucidate the dynamics of transmission of nasopharyngeal bacteria.\n",

      "Rationale: Experimental evidence suggests that CDHR3 (cadherin-related family member 3) is a receptor for rhinovirus (RV)-C, and a missense variant in this gene (rs6967330) is associated with childhood asthma with severe exacerbations. Objectives: To determine whether rs6967330 influences RV-C infections and illnesses in early childhood. Methods: We studied associations between rs6967330 and respiratory infections and illnesses in the COPSAC(2010) (Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010) and COAST (Childhood Origins of Asthma Birth Cohort Study) birth cohorts, where respiratory infections were monitored prospectively for the first 3 years of life. Nasal samples were collected during acute infections in both cohorts and during asymptomatic periods in COAST and analyzed for RV-A, RV-B, and RV-C, and other common respiratory viruses. Measurements and Main Results: The CDHR3 asthma risk allele (rs6967330-A) was associated with increased risk of respiratory tract illnesses (incidence risk ratio [IRR] = 1.14 [95% confidence interval, 1.05–1.23]; P = 0.003). In particular, this variant was associated with risk of respiratory episodes with detection of RV-C in COPSAC(2010) (IRR = 1.89 [1.14–3.05]; P = 0.01) and in COAST (IRR = 1.37 [1.02–1.82]; P = 0.03) children, and in a combined meta-analysis (IRR = 1.51 [1.13–2.02]; P = 0.006). In contrast, the variant was not associated with illnesses related to other viruses (IRR = 1.07 [0.92–1.25]; P = 0.37). Consistent with these observations, the CDHR3 variant was associated with increased detection of RV-C, but not of other viruses during scheduled visits at specific ages. Conclusions: The CDHR3 asthma risk allele is associated specifically with RV-C illnesses in two birth cohorts. This clinical evidence supports earlier molecular evidence indicating that CDHR3 functions as an RV-C receptor, and raises the possibility of preventing RV-C infections by targeting CDHR3.\n",

      "PROBLEM: The Chinese central government launched the Health System Reform Plan in 2009 to strengthen disease control and health promotion and provide a package of basic public health services. Village doctors receive a modest subsidy for providing public health services associated with the package. Their beliefs about this subsidy and providing public health services could influence the quality and effectiveness of preventive health services and disease surveillance. APPROACH: To understand village doctors’ perspectives on the subsidy and their experiences of delivering public health services, we performed 10 focus group discussions with village doctors, 12 in-depth interviews with directors of township health centres and 4 in-depth interviews with directors of county-level Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. LOCAL SETTING: The study was conducted in four counties in central China, two in Hubei province and two in Jiangxi province. RELEVANT CHANGES: Village doctors prioritize medical services but they do their best to manage their time to include public health services. The willingness of township health centre directors and village doctors to provide public health services has improved since the introduction of the package and a minimum subsidy, but village doctors do not find the subsidy to be sufficient remuneration for their efforts. LESSONS LEARNT: Improving the delivery of public health services by village doctors is likely to require an increase in the subsidy, improvement in the supervisory relationship between village clinics and township health centres and the creation of a government pension for village doctors.\n",

      "PROBLEM: Improving pandemic planning and preparedness is a challenge in Europe, a diverse region whose regional bodies (the Regional Office for Europe of the World Health Organization [WHO], the European Commission and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) have overlapping roles and responsibilities. APPROACH: European pandemic preparedness indicators were used to develop an assessment tool and procedure based on the 2005 global WHO checklist for pandemic preparedness. These were then applied to Member States of WHO’s European Region, initially as part of structured national assessments conducted during short visits by external teams. LOCAL SETTING: Countries in WHO’s European Region. RELEVANT CHANGES: From 2005 to 2008, 43 countries underwent a pandemic preparedness assessment that included a short external assessment visit by an expert team. These short visits developed into a longer self-assessment procedure involving an external team but “owned” by the countries, which identified gaps and developed plans for improving preparedness. The assessment tool and procedure became more sophisticated as national and local pandemic preparedness became more complex. The 2009 pandemic revealed new gaps in planning, surveillance communications and immunization. LESSONS LEARNT: Structured national self-assessments with support from external teams allow individual countries to identify gaps in their pandemic preparedness plans and enable regional bodies to assess the regional and global resources that such plans require. The 2009 pandemic revealed additional problems with surveillance, pandemic severity estimates, the flexibility of the response, vaccination, involvement of health-care workers and communication. European national plans are being upgraded and global leadership is required to ensure that these plans are uniformly applied across the region.\n",

      "Rationale: Ex vivo, bronchial epithelial cells from people with asthma are more susceptible to rhinovirus infection caused by deficient induction of the antiviral protein, IFN-β. Exogenous IFN-β restores antiviral activity. Objectives: To compare the efficacy and safety of inhaled IFN-β with placebo administered to people with asthma after onset of cold symptoms to prevent or attenuate asthma symptoms caused by respiratory viruses. Methods: A total of 147 people with asthma on inhaled corticosteroids (British Thoracic Society Steps 2–5), with a history of virus-associated exacerbations, were randomized to 14-day treatment with inhaled IFN-β (n = 72) or placebo (n = 75) within 24 hours of developing cold symptoms and were assessed clinically, with relevant samples collected to assess virus infection and antiviral responses. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 91% of randomized patients developed a defined cold. In this modified intention-to-treat population, asthma symptoms did not get clinically significantly worse (mean change in six-item Asthma Control Questionnaire <0.5) and IFN-β treatment had no significant effect on this primary endpoint, although it enhanced morning peak expiratory flow recovery (P = 0.033), reduced the need for additional treatment, and boosted innate immunity as assessed by blood and sputum biomarkers. In an exploratory analysis of the subset of more difficult-to-treat, Step 4-5 people with asthma (n = 27 IFN-β; n = 31 placebo), Asthma Control Questionnaire-6 increased significantly on placebo; this was prevented by IFN-β (P = 0.004). Conclusions: Although the trial did not meet its primary endpoint, it suggests that inhaled IFN-β is a potential treatment for virus-induced deteriorations of asthma in difficult-to-treat people with asthma and supports the need for further, adequately powered, trials in this population. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01126177).\n",

      "Rationale: Most asthma exacerbations are initiated by viral upper respiratory illnesses. It is unclear whether human rhinovirus (HRV)–induced exacerbations are associated with greater viral replication and neutrophilic inflammation compared with HRV colds. Objectives: To evaluate viral strain and load in a prospective asthma cohort during a natural cold. Methods: Adults were enrolled at the first sign of a cold, with daily monitoring of symptoms, medication use, and peak expiratory flow rate until resolution. Serial nasal lavage and induced sputum samples were assessed for viral copy number and inflammatory cell counts. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 52 persons with asthma and 14 control subjects without atopy or asthma were studied for over 10 weeks per subject on average; 25 participants developed an asthma exacerbation. Detection of HRVs in the preceding 5 days was the most common attributable exposure related to exacerbation. Compared with other infections, those by a minor group A HRV were 4.4-fold more likely to cause exacerbation (P = 0.038). Overall, sputum neutrophils and the burden of rhinovirus in the lower airway were similar in control subjects without atopy and the asthma group. However, among HRV-infected participants with asthma, exacerbations were associated with greater sputum neutrophil counts (P = 0.005). Conclusions: HRV infection is a frequent cause of exacerbations in adults with asthma and a cold, and there may be group-specific differences in severity of these events. The absence of large differences in viral burden among groups suggests differential lower airway sensitization to the effects of neutrophilic inflammation in the patients having exacerbations.\n",

      "Context: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerging infectious disease and how the frontline community doctors respond to it is not known. Objectives: To explore the impact of SARS on general practitioners (GPs) in Hong Kong. Design: A cross sectional survey. Setting: Community based primary care clinics. Participants: 183 family medicine tutors affiliated with a local university. Postal survey sent to all tutors with a 74.8% response rate. Main outcome measures: Change of clinical behaviour and practices during the epidemic; anxiety level of primary care doctors. Results: All agreed SARS had changed their clinical practices. Significant anxiety was found in family doctors. Three quarters of respondents recalled requesting more investigations while a quarter believed they had over-prescribed antibiotics. GPs who were exposed to SARS or who had worked in high infection districts were less likely to quarantine themselves (10.8% versus 33.3%; p<0.01; 6.5% versus 27.5%; p<0.01 respectively). Exposure to SARS, the infection rates in their working district, and anxiety levels had significant impact on the level of protection or prescribing behaviour. Conclusion: The clinical practice of GPs changed significantly as a result of SARS. Yet, those did not quarantine themselves suggesting other factors may have some part to play. As failure to apply isolation precautions to suspected cases of SARS was one major reason for its spread, a contingency plan from the government to support family doctors is of utmost importance. Interface between private and public sectors are needed in Hong Kong to prepare for any future epidemics.\n",

      "Rationale: Endothelial dysfunction plays an integral role in pulmonary hypertension (PH). AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) and ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) are crucial in endothelial homeostasis. The mechanism by which AMPK regulates ACE2 in the pulmonary endothelium and its protective role in PH remain elusive. Objectives: We investigated the role of AMPK phosphorylation of ACE2 Ser680 in ACE2 stability and deciphered the functional consequences of this post-translational modification of ACE2 in endothelial homeostasis and PH. Methods: Bioinformatics prediction, kinase assay, and antibody against phospho-ACE2 Ser680 (p-ACE2 S680) were used to investigate AMPK phosphorylation of ACE2 Ser680 in endothelial cells. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genomic editing, we created gain-of-function ACE2 S680D knock-in and loss-of-function ACE2 knockout (ACE2(−/−)) mouse lines to address the involvement of p-ACE2 S680 and ACE2 in PH. The AMPK–p-ACE2 S680 axis was also validated in lung tissue from humans with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Measurements and Main Results: Phosphorylation of ACE2 by AMPK enhanced the stability of ACE2, which increased Ang (angiotensin) 1–7 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase–derived NO bioavailability. ACE2 S680D knock-in mice were resistant to PH as compared with wild-type littermates. In contrast, ACE2-knockout mice exacerbated PH, a similar phenotype found in mice with endothelial cell–specific deletion of AMPKα2. Consistently, the concentrations of phosphorylated AMPK, p-ACE2 S680, and ACE2 were decreased in human lungs with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Conclusions: Impaired phosphorylation of ACE2 Ser680 by AMPK in pulmonary endothelium leads to a labile ACE2 and hence is associated with the pathogenesis of PH. Thus, AMPK regulation of the vasoprotective ACE2 is a potential target for PH treatment.\n",

      "RATIONALE: Neurogenic hypertension is characterized by an increase in sympathetic activity and often resistance to drug treatments. We previously reported that it is also associated with a reduction of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and an increase in A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) activity in experimental hypertension. In addition, while multiple cells within the central nervous system have been involved in the development of neurogenic hypertension, the contribution of ADAM17 has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical relevance of this ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding in hypertensive patients and further identify the cell types and signaling pathways involved in this process. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a mass spectrometry-based assay, we identified ACE2 as the main enzyme converting Ang II into Ang-(1–7) in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We also observed an increase in ACE2 activity in the CSF of hypertensive patients, which was correlated with systolic blood pressure. Moreover, the increased level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in those CSF samples confirmed that ADAM17 was up-regulated in the hypertensive patients’ brain. To further assess the interaction between brain renin-angiotensin system and ADAM17, we generated mice lacking Angiotensin II type 1 receptors (AT(1)R) specifically on neurons. Our data reveal that despite expression on astrocytes and other cells types in the brain, ADAM17 up-regulation during DOCA-salt hypertension occurs selectively on neurons and neuronal AT(1)R are indispensable to this process. Mechanistically, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were found to mediate ADAM17 activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that AT(1)R promote ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding in the brain of hypertensive patients, leading to a loss in compensatory activity during neurogenic hypertension.\n",

      "Rationale: Acute lung dysfunction of noninfectious etiology, known as idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), is a severe complication following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Several mouse models have been recently developed to determine the underlying causes of IPS. A cohesive interpretation of experimental data and their relationship to the findings of clinical research studies in humans is needed to better understand the basis for current and future clinical trials for the prevention/treatment of IPS. Objectives: Our goal was to perform a comprehensive review of the preclinical (i.e., murine models) and clinical research on IPS. Methods: An ATS committee performed PubMed and OVID searches for published, peer-reviewed articles using the keywords “idiopathic pneumonia syndrome” or “lung injury” or “pulmonary complications” AND “bone marrow transplant” or “hematopoietic stem cell transplant.” No specific inclusion or exclusion criteria were determined a priori for this review. Measurements and Main Results: Experimental models that reproduce the various patterns of lung injury observed after HSCT have identified that both soluble and cellular inflammatory mediators contribute to the inflammation engendered during the development of IPS. To date, 10 preclinical murine models of the IPS spectrum have been established using various donor and host strain combinations used to study graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This, as well as the demonstrated T cell dependency of IPS development in these models, supports the concept that the lung is a target of immune-mediated attack after HSCT. The most developed therapeutic strategy for IPS involves blocking TNF signaling with etanercept, which is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Conclusions: IPS remains a frequently fatal complication that limits the broader use of allogeneic HSCT as a successful treatment modality. Faced with the clinical syndrome of IPS, one can categorize the disease entity with the appropriate tools, although cases of unclassifiable IPS will remain. Significant research efforts have resulted in a paradigm shift away from identifying noninfectious lung injury after HSCT solely as an idiopathic clinical syndrome and toward understanding IPS as a process involving aspects of both the adaptive and the innate immune response. Importantly, new laboratory insights are currently being translated to the clinic and will likely prove important to the development of future strategies to prevent or treat this serious disorder.\n",

      "CONTEXT: Pneumonia is the leading cause of childhood death in sub-Saharan Africa. Comparative estimates of the contribution of causative pathogens to the burden of disease are essential for targeted vaccine development. OBJECTIVE: To determine the viral etiology of severe pneumonia among infants and children at a rural Kenyan hospital using comprehensive and sensitive molecular diagnostic techniques. DESIGN, SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Prospective observational and case control study during 2007 in a rural Kenyan district hospital. We recruited children age 1 day to 12 years who were resident in a systematically enumerated catchment area: i) those admitted to Kilifi District Hospital meeting WHO clinical criteria for ‘severe pneumonia’ or ‘very severe pneumonia’; ii) those presenting with mild upper respiratory tract infection but not admitted and iii) well infants and children attending for immunization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence of respiratory viruses and the odds ratio for admission with severe disease. RESULTS: 759/922 (83%) eligible admissions were sampled (median age 9 months). One or more respiratory viruses were detected in 425/759 (56%, 95% CI 52 to 60%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in 260 (34%, 95% CI 31 to 38%) and other respiratory viruses in 219 (29%, 95% CI 26 to 32%), the commonest being human coronavirus 229E (n=51, 6.7%, 95% CI 5.0 to 8.7%), influenza type A (n=44, 5.8%, 95% CI 4.2 to 7.7%), parainfluenza type 3 (n=29, 3.8%, 95% CI 2.6 to 5.4%), adenovirus (n=29, 3.8%, 95% CI 2.6 to 5.4%) and human metapneumovirus (n=23, 3.0%, 95% CI 1.9 to 4.5%). Compared to well controls, detection of RSV was associated with severe disease (4% in controls, adjusted odds Ratio 6.11 [95% CI 1.65 to 22.6]) whilst collectively, other respiratory viruses were not (23% in controls, adjusted odds Ratio 1.27 [95% CI 0.64 to 2.52]). CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of Kenyan infants and children admitted with severe pneumonia to a rural hospital, RSV was the predominant viral pathogen.\n",

      "CONTEXT: In the United States (U.S.), state laws require healthcare providers to report specific diseases and events to public health authorities, a fundamental facet of disease surveillance. However, reporting by providers is often inconsistent, infrequent and delayed. OBJECTIVE: To examine knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding and understand current barriers to provider disease reporting. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted via an anonymous, standardized electronic survey. SETTING: The survey was conducted at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, a large, tertiary academic medical center in Nashville, Tennessee. PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare providers in four specialties (internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics-gynecology and emergency medicine). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Knowledge of and attitudes regarding provider reporting of diseases to public health authorities in Tennessee. RESULTS: The majority of providers acknowledged they cared for patients with reportable diseases (362/435, 83.2%) and believed that it was their responsibility to report to public health authorities (429/436, 98.4%); however less than half had ever reported a case (206/436, 47.2%). The median percent correct on the knowledge assessment of Tennessee reportable diseases and conditions was 81.3% (Interquartile Range [IQR] 68.8–87.5). Providers cited a lack of knowledge of which diseases are reportable (186/429, 43.3%) and the logistics of reporting (153/429, 35.7%) as the primary barriers for compliance. CONCLUSIONS: Most providers acknowledged they cared for patients with reportable diseases and believed they had an obligation to report to public health authorities. However, a lack of knowledge about reporting was frequently described as a limitation to report effectively. Many knowledge deficits were significantly greater among residents than other providers. The policy and practice implications of these findings include a demonstrated need for education of providers about disease reporting as well as development of more convenient reporting mechanisms. Fundamental knowledge of reportable disease requirements and procedures is critical for participation in the broader public health system.\n",

      "PROBLEM: There is only limited knowledge on the burden of disease due to both new (HCoV-NL63 and HKU-1) and previously discovered coronaviruses (OC43 and 229E) in children. METHOD OF STUDY: Respiratory specimens and clinical data were prospectively collected in an active, population-based surveillance study over a two-year period from children aged <5 years hospitalized with acute respiratory symptoms or fever. These samples were retrospectively tested by real-time RT-PCR for HCoV-NL63, HKU1, OC43 and 229E. RESULTS: Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were identified in 2.2% of study children <2 years of age. Rates of HCoV-associated hospitalization per 10,000 were 10.2 (95% CI 4.3, 17.6), 4.2 (95% CI 1.9, 6.9), and 0 (95% CI 0, 3.7) in children aged <6 months, 6-23 months, and 24-59 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: Coronaviruses were identified in a modest number of hospitalized children.\n",

      "RATIONALE: The majority of asthma exacerbations are related to viral respiratory infections. Some, but not all, previous studies have reported that low interferon responses in patients with asthma increase the risk for virus-induced exacerbations. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the relationship between lower airway inflammatory biomarkers, specifically interferon gene expression, and the severity or presence of an exacerbation in asthmatics experiencing a naturally occurring viral infection. METHODS: Sputum samples were analyzed from subjects in an asthma exacerbation study who experienced a confirmed viral infection. Subjects were monitored for daily symptoms, medication use, and peak expiratory flow rate until baseline. Sputum samples were assessed for cell counts and gene expression. RESULTS: IFN-γ expression was significantly greater in patients with asthma exacerbations compared to non-exacerbating patients (p=0.002). IFN-α1, IFN-β1, and IFN-γ mRNA levels correlated with the peak Asthma Index (r=0.58, p<0.001; r=0.57, p=0.001; and r=0.51, p=0.004, respectively). Additionally, IL-13, IL-10 and eosinophil major basic protein mRNA levels were greater in patients with asthma exacerbations compared to non-exacerbating patients (p=0.03, p=0.06, and p=0.02, respectively), and IL-13 mRNA correlated with the peak Asthma Index (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that asthma exacerbations are associated with increased rather than decreased expression of interferons early in the course of infection. These findings raise the possibility that excessive virus-induced interferon production during acute infections can contribute to airway inflammation and exacerbations of asthma.\n",

      "PROBLEM: In 2003, China’s handling of the early stages of the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was heavily criticized and generally considered to be suboptimal. APPROACH: Following the SARS outbreak, China made huge investments to improve surveillance, emergency preparedness and response capacity and strengthen public health institutions. In 2013, the return on these investments was evaluated by investigating China’s early response to the emergence of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in humans. LOCAL SETTING: Clusters of human infection with a novel influenza virus were detected in China – by national surveillance of pneumonia of unknown etiology – on 26 February 2013. RELEVANT CHANGES: On 31 March 2013, China notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of the first recorded human infections with A(H7N9) virus. Poultry markets – which were rapidly identified as a major source of transmission of A(H7N9) to humans – were closed down in the affected areas. Surveillance in humans and poultry was heightened and technical guidelines were quickly updated and disseminated. The health authorities collaborated with WHO in risk assessments and risk communication. New cases were reported promptly and publicly. LESSONS LEARNT: The relevant infrastructures, surveillance systems and response capacity need to be strengthened in preparation for future emergencies caused by emerging or existing disease threats. Results of risk assessments and other data should be released promptly and publicly and such release should not jeopardize future publication of the data in scientific journals. Coordination between public health and veterinary services would be stronger during an emergency if these services had already undertaken joint preparedness planning.\n",

      "Rationale: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Streptococcus pneumoniae are major respiratory pathogens. Coinfection with RSV and S. pneumoniae is associated with severe and often fatal pneumonia but the molecular basis for this remains unclear. Objectives: To determine if interaction between RSV and pneumococci enhances pneumococcal virulence. Methods: We used confocal microscopy and Western blot to identify the receptors involved in direct binding of RSV and pneumococci, the effects of which were studied in both in vivo and in vitro models of infection. Human ciliated respiratory epithelial cell cultures were infected with RSV for 72 hours and then challenged with pneumococci. Pneumococci were collected after 2 hours exposure and changes in gene expression determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Measurements and Main Results: Following incubation with RSV or purified G protein, pneumococci demonstrated a significant increase in the inflammatory response and bacterial adherence to human ciliated epithelial cultures and markedly increased virulence in a pneumonia model in mice. This was associated with extensive changes in the pneumococcal transcriptome and significant up-regulation in the expression of key pneumococcal virulence genes, including the gene for the pneumococcal toxin, pneumolysin. We show that mechanistically this is caused by RSV G glycoprotein binding penicillin binding protein 1a. Conclusions: The direct interaction between a respiratory virus protein and the pneumococcus resulting in increased bacterial virulence and worsening disease outcome is a new paradigm in respiratory infection.\n",

      "CONTEXT: Efficient management and allocation of scarce medical resources can improve outcomes for victims of Mass Casualty Events (MCEs). However, the effectiveness of specific strategies has never been systematically reviewed. OBJECTIVES: We analyzed published evidence on strategies to optimize the management and allocation of scarce resources across a wide range of MCE contexts and study designs. DATA SOURCES: Our literature search included Medline, Scopus, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Global Health, Web of Science®, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, from 1990 through late 2011. We also searched the grey literature using the New York Academy of Medicine’s Grey Literature Report and key websites. We included both English and foreign language articles. STUDY SELECTION: We included studies that evaluated strategies employed in real-world MCEs or tested through drills, exercises, or computer simulations. We excluded studies that lacked a comparison group or did not report quantitative outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data extraction, quality assessment, and strength of evidence ratings were conducted by a single researcher and reviewed by a second; discrepancies were reconciled by the two reviewers. Due to heterogeneity in outcome measures, we qualitatively synthesized findings within categories of strategies. RESULTS: From 5,716 potentially relevant citations, 74 studies met inclusion criteria. Strategies included: reducing demand for healthcare services (18 studies), optimizing use of existing resources (50), augmenting existing resources (5), implementing crisis standards of care (5), and multiple categories (4). The evidence was sufficient to form conclusions on two strategies, although the strength of evidence was rated as low. First, as a strategy to reduce demand for healthcare services, Points of Dispensing (PODs) can be used to efficiently distribute biological countermeasures following a bioterror attack or influenza pandemic, and their organization influences speed of distribution. Second, as a strategy to optimize use of existing resources, commonly used field triage systems do not perform consistently during actual MCEs. The number of high-quality studies addressing other strategies was insufficient to support conclusions about their effectiveness because of differences in study context, comparison groups, and outcome measures. LIMITATIONS: Our literature search may have missed key resource management and allocation strategies due to their extreme heterogeneity. Inter-rater reliability was not assessed for quality assessments or strength of evidence ratings. Publication bias is likely given the large number of studies reporting positive findings. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence base is inadequate to inform providers and policymakers about the most effective strategies for managing or allocating scarce resources during MCEs. Consensus on methodological standards that encompass a range of study designs is needed to guide future research and strengthen the evidence base. Evidentiary standards should be developed to promote consensus interpretations of the evidence supporting individual strategies.\n",

      "CONTEXT: Respiratory infections are prevalent in the elderly, resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, and utilization of health care services. Vitamin E supplementation has been shown to improve immune response in the elderly. However, the clinical importance of these findings has not been determined. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of 1-year vitamin E supplementation on respiratory infections in elderly nursing home residents DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from April 1998 to August 2001 SETTING: 33 long-term care facilities in the Boston, Massachusetts area PARTICIPANTS: 617 subjects ≥65 years old, who met the study’s eligibility criteria were enrolled, 73% of whom completed the study. The follow-up time (mean ± SD) was 317±104 and 321±97 days, E and placebo respectively, for all subjects enrolled in the study. INTERVENTION: A daily vitamin E (200 IU) or placebo capsule; all subjects received a capsule containing 1/2 the Recommended Daily Allowance of essential vitamins and minerals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence, number of subjects and number of days with respiratory infections (upper and lower), and number of new antibiotic prescriptions. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant effect of vitamin E on incidence or number of days with infection for all, upper, or lower respiratory infections. However, fewer vitamin E-supplemented subjects acquired one or more respiratory infections (65% vs 74%, risk ratio=0.88, 95% CI=0.75–0.99, p=0.036 for completed subjects; 60% vs 68%, risk ratio=0.88, 95% CI=0.76–1.00, p=0.048 for all subjects), or upper respiratory infections (50% vs 62%, risk ratio = 0.81, 95% CI=0.66–0.96, p=0.013 for completed subjects; 44% vs 52%, risk ratio=0.84, 95% CI=0.69–1.00, p=0.051 for all subjects). Post hoc sub-group analysis on common colds indicated that the vitamin E group had a lower incidence of common cold (0.66 vs 0.83 per subject-year, rate ratio=0.80, 95% CI=0.64–0.98, p=0.035 for completed subjects; 0.67 vs 0.81 per subject-year, rate ratio=0.83, 95% CI=0.68–1.01, p=0.057 for all subjects) and fewer subjects in the vitamin E group acquired one or more colds (46% vs 57%, risk ratio=0.80, 95% CI=0.64–0.96, p=0.016 for completed subjects; 40% vs 48%, risk ratio=0.83, 95% CI=0.67–1.00, p=0.052 for all subjects). There was no statistically significant vitamin E effect on antibiotic use. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with 200 IU per day vitamin E did not have a statistically significant effect on lower respiratory infections in elderly nursing home residents. However, we observed a protective effect of vitamin E supplementation on upper respiratory infections, particularly the common cold, that merits further investigation.\n",

      "Hypotheses: (i) Flow cytometry has the potential for rapid detection of respiratory viral antigens. (ii) This technique can be applied to viral diagnosis in clinical samples. Objectives and study design: (i) To study the identification of six common respiratory viral pathogens by flow cytometry, in virus infected and uninfected cultured cells, as models of positive and negative clinical samples. (ii) To compare flow cytometry with the established techniques of viral isolation and immunofluorescent microscopy in the diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus infection in 68 naso-pharyngeal aspirates taken from children and sent to the virology laboratory for routine virological diagnosis. Results: (i) For each virus analysed, populations of infected and non-infected cells were clearly discernable, confirming potential for this method in rapid viral diagnosis in clinical samples. (ii) Two definitions were employed for a sample to be positive by flow cytometry, these were compared with the combined established techniques. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of flow cytometry were 41%, 98%, 92% and 71% for the first definition and 74%, 88%, 80% and 84% for the second definition respectively. Conclusions: As tested in this study, flow cytometry is less sensitive than established techniques as well as recently developed rapid diagnostic techniques for the diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus infection. Further evaluation of the potential of flow cytometry in rapid viral diagnosis is warranted.\n",

      "ISSUE: The Warren G Magnuson Clinical Center (CC) strives to achieve a balance between its mission and worker and patient safety. PROJECT: As part of its mission as one of the government's primary research facilities, the CC must be able to address epidemiologically significant public health concerns as they arise. After its initial description in the fall of 2002, the global threat of SARS became readily apparent. To address its mission, investigators working at the CC designed two protocols to study this new disease. To protect our patients and our staff, we quickly developed infection control guidelines based on what was known about the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this new disease. RESULTS: We created a multidisciplinary team to identify risk points during the admission and treatment phases of these protocols. This group met once or twice weekly for 6 months. New policies and procedures were created which were patterned after the CDC guidelines but which met the unique needs of our existing infrastructure and patient populations. We created a new position (isolation monitor) to ensure compliance with infection control precautions. We also conducted a failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) to identify additional areas of risk. Policies and procedures were reviewed by: 1) a multi-institute physician committee, 2) an external expert in hospital epidemiology, and 3) the CC Medical Executive Committee. Detailed practice sessions have been held to ensure compliance with these new and detailed precautions. LESSONS LEARNED: Readiness for complex infectious diseases is multifaceted and requires advance planning and detailed assessments. Preparing for SARS has placed our organization in a much better position to deal with emerging airborne infectious diseases.\n",

      "ISSUE: The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 challenged the world of infection control. During the SARS epidemic, Toronto was included as a travel location in the SARS definition. The lack of preparedness at our facility became evident in June 2003, when a patient was admitted with a fever, infiltrates, and recent travel to Toronto. This admission revealed many failure modes in our system for identifying and containing SARS. Twenty-one healthcare workers (HCWs) had unprotected exposure to the suspected case. As a result, the HCWs were screened prior to reporting to work for the 10 days following their exposure. Improper handling of lab specimens delayed testing. The case eventually was ruled out as a SARS case. PROJECT: A multidisciplinary team was formed to conduct a root-cause analysis (RCA) of the potential SARS exposure. Several process failures were identified, from admission through specimen handling. The team recognized that the frequency of admitting a SARS patient was low; however, the potential health threat was high. Rather than conduct additional educational sessions, a SARS Toolkit was developed for the hospital units. The kit contained step-by-step instructions, visuals, and a notification list. The kit's built-in forcing functions were designed to move the process along, but not to rely on HCWs memory. The new process was tested in a mock SARS admission drill. Only administration and the RCA team knew about the drill. The drill was completed in 3 hours. RESULTS: The kit was activated immediately and key departments, including infection control, were notified. Personal protective equipment was obtained and the patient was placed in the proper isolation. Laboratory specimens were processed and handled appropriately. HCW exposure did not occur. The kit assisted in preventing exposures while allowing for patient care. A debriefing followed the drill and included all HCWs involved, administration, and the RCA team. The mock patient was able to provide additional information regarding objects with potential fomite contamination that were brought out of the room. LESSONS LEARNED: Preparedness for events that may or may not occur challenged us to create a process that would succeed. Overall, the kit proved its worth with well-defined instructions for communication. At any time, it could easily be updated. It was identified that some signage needed clarification, and changes were made to the kit. The kit has since been adopted by our system hospitals.\n",

      "ISSUE: Influenza infections affect 20% of the U.S. population, with an average of 110,000 hospitalizations and 36,000 deaths annually. The shortage of influenza vaccine for the 2004–2005 season brought with it the potential for an even higher rate of morbidity and mortality due to influenza. The Infection Control and Healthcare Epidemiology Consortium of a 12-hospital healthcare system located in St. Louis, Missouri, determined that a comprehensive multi-tiered influenza management plan was needed. PROJECT: A team of four infection control practitioners (ICPs) was established from three of the system's hospitals, including a large, metropolitan teaching hospital, a comprehensive pediatric hospital, and a small community hospital, along with three system-level consultants, under the advisement of their medical directors. The team developed a resource packet containing a comprehensive multi-tiered influenza management plan. The packet included a core policy, to be customized by each entity, a checklist of recommended materials to have on hand, and algorithms for influenza testing, patient placement, and healthcare worker immunization. The packet also included an admission screening tool, examples of local health department' line list reports, and educational posters to be used throughout the healthcare facilities to heighten influenza infection prevention awareness. Many of the tools have specific recommendations for different stages of the influenza season; for example, extensive use of rapid diagnostic tests is appropriate early on, but unnecessary during peak flu season when diagnosis can reliably be made based on symptoms. The packet was developed as a guide to assist ICPs in preparing for an influenza season. RESULTS: A resource packet with a comprehensive multi-tiered influenza management plan was developed for all of the system's hospitals. The packet contains information addressing the action to be taken prior to and at the early onset of the influenza season, when there is an increased level of influenza activity, and during a pandemic event. LESSONS LEARNED: Annual influenza outbreaks are a serious threat to U.S. patients. To reduce that threat, it is necessary to carefully plan and prepare for each influenza season. A resource packet with a comprehensive multi-tiered influenza management plan is a useful tool in making the necessary plans and preparations.\n",

      "ISSUE: In September 2003, the state health department, along with our facility, mandated that we develop a response plan for the possible re-emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). We convened a multidisciplinary SARS task force, and five team members were given responsibility for writing the plan. During that time, we learned that respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette guidelines were being developed by the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC). There was also a threat of a heavy early flu season, and we needed to provide easy access to hygiene supplies in all hospital and clinic waiting areas and lobbies. PROJECT: The SARS planning group came up with an idea for a “sneeze station” since our policy required that facial tissues, hand sanitizers, waste receptacles, masks, and instructional signage be readily available in all hospital and clinic lobbies and waiting rooms. We took our idea to the director of plant operations and the sneeze station concept was approved. A carpenter was assigned to develop a prototype, and after a few minor revisions by the SARS task force the sneeze station was born. Wall-mounted and rolling floor models were designed to accommodate the various space needs in our facility. It was decided that masks would not be placed on the sneeze stations, but would be available at all reception desks due to concerns of inappropriate use. Our faculty and staff were educated on the respiratory hygiene policy and sneeze stations during the February 2004 mandatory safety fair. RESULTS: As of January 2005, we have placed 180 sneeze stations in our hospitals and clinics as well as in other institutions. When new areas open, one of the first concerns is to make sure they get their sneeze stations. The sneeze stations are continuously being used based on audits of supply usage and through monitoring by the environment of care (EOC) tours. LESSONS LEARNED: The sneeze stations are accepted in the medical center as a valuable part of infection control. There are times when supply cannot keep up with demand because we only have one carpenter assigned to manufacture the sneeze stations. Another lesson learned is that placing the station in a cafeteria may result in it being used as a food disposal instead of for its intended purpose. Overall, the sneeze station has met with great success, and this proves that creative ideas can bring about change.\n",

      "ISSUE: Both the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization's (JCAHO) patient safety goal and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) guidelines recommend monitoring of hand hygiene adherence and providing feedback to patient care staff. In order to advance patient safety and HH compliance, a three-pronged approach was implemented to enhance HH education, observation and measurement of HH compliance. PROJECT: Three components were implemented to improve compliance with HH practices: Education Component (Phase I) Development and implementation of a mandatory computer-based learning module on hand hygiene for all patient care staff that included HH's “Top Ten List” based on CDC's Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health-Care Settings, 2002 Focused and targeted educational program for fellows, residents and mid-level providers including staff in invasive procedural areas Special educational HH program in Spanish for spanish-speaking staff Training of unit-based HH observers (100) using the Train-the-Trainer model Focus on HH compliance during Patient Safety Week Campaign in March 2005 Evaluation Component (Phase II) Three HH observational periods for assessment of HH compliance by trained HH monitors and infection control practitioners in all patient care areas Monthly self-assessment in patient care area units and diagnostic areas Communication and Feedback of Results Component (Phase III) Communication to staff, managers and administration regarding HH violations and compliance rates Prompt follow-up with re-education in patient care areas where HH violations rates were lower than expected. RESULTS: In Phase I, 100% of patient care staff complied with HH computer-based training. A total of 100 unit-based HH observers were trained using the Train-the-Trainer approach with education on HH basics, use of HH tool and feedback to colleagues and peers. In Phases II and III, observational periods with assessment of HH compliance were implemented by the trained HH observer of each clinical area. Data from observation periods, demonstrated an incremental improvement in HH practices with an initial baseline of 79% and an average of 91% in subsequent periods. LESSONS LEARNED: A coordinated systems approach that includes patient care staff, physicians, committees and administration is essential when initiating a process change. Providing education and feedback to staff and physicians will improve compliance. Identification of areas where additional education and feedback on HH is required and will also improve compliance.\n",

      "ISSUE: A proactive Legionella control program combining continuous disinfection of the water distribution system, environmental sampling and active case detection was established in a large urban hospital in the early 1990's. While cases of community-acquired disease are generally seen in the area during the rainy spring months, no patients had been identified with hospital acquired infection until Sept. 2005, after a particularly hot, dry summer. PROJECT: In order to prevent additional infections, all systems were immediately reviewed. Routine cultures of hospital sinks and showers had occasionally shown low levels of Legionella pneumophila in less than 30% of samples collected. There were no disruptions in the water supply and readings from the copper-silver ionization system were within range. Although the hospital's hot water supply is disinfected by the system, the cold water supply is not treated since the cooler water is not considered to be at increased risk for Legionella multiplication. After the case was identified, cultures were collected from additional water sources, including the new state of the art ice and water dispenser that served the patient unit. Maintenance personnel provided documentation that the unit was cleaned and sanitized as per manufacturer's instructions and provided the service manual for review. RESULTS: Cultures collected from the dispenser's water chute showed confluent growth of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1. Isolates from the environment and patient submitted to a reference lab for Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) had identical patterns. Periodic cleaning procedures in the manual stated that a chlorinated cleaning solution (200 ppm available chlorine) should be used, followed by a sanitizing solution (50 ppm). Since this sequence was reversed from our usual disinfection practices, the manufacturer of the recommended cleaner was contacted. The company was unaware that their product was mentioned and confirmed that these steps were incorrectly listed. Another factor leading to the disinfection failure was identified- maintenance personnel did not realize that the solutions were to be 75°F-125°F. LESSONS LEARNED: During the hot summer months, water coming in from the municipal water supply was reported to be unusually warm, theoretically allowing small numbers of Legionella in the water to multiply. While the preventative maintenance schedule was being followed according to the manufacturer's instructions, the incorrect dilution sequence and low temperature of the solution used potentially allowed the interior surfaces of the machine to develop a biofilm layer containing Legionella - a problem common in our hard water area. While we thought that our high-tech, proactive system was working wonderfully, all it took was a cool drink on a hot day to break our winning streak of Legionella prevention. And an unfortunate patient with a history of aspiration.\n",

      "ISSUE: The 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) underscored the importance of rapid recognition and isolation of patients with highly communicable diseases to prevent nosocominal spread to other patients, staff, and visitors. The SARS issue and a recent outbreak of measles in New York City (NYC) highlighted the need for EDs to have effective measures to rapidly triage and isolate patients with potentially communicable illnesses. PROJECT: A multidisciplinary team at a NYC hospital developed a screening and isolation protocol in collaboration with the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Education and training was provided through classroom instruction using a train the trainer format. This training included a power point presentation along with interactive case scenarios. Pre and post tests, and a series of unannounced drills were used to evaluate the process. RESULTS: Ninety percent of registered nurses, 67% of emergency medical physicians, 82% of emergency service assistants, 63% of patient access workers and 73% of social workers in the ED were in-serviced. Patient access workers failed to follow the quick registration process for patients presenting with a cough. The triage nurse was able to isolate the patient based on symptoms and travel history, and knew the appropriate mask to be worn by the patient versus the medical staff. However, basic infection control including hand hygiene was not consistently practiced. Personal Protective Equipment was not readily available in the triage area. LESSONS LEARNED: Although a large proportion of the ED staff received training, breaches in basic infection control were observed. Consistency of educational in-service was difficult to assure using the train the trainer format. Increased involvement of Infection Control Professionals is needed to help translate education into practice, and to improve compliance with procedures.\n",
