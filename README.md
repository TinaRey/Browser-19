# Browser-19
Repository for the hackathon Lauzhack Against COVID-19

This project aims to provide a visual way to browse through the papers related to the different coronaviruses. . We developped a graph structure of a subset of these papers to show how this can be an interesting visualization for researchers that want to quickly have an overview of the existing papers.

We based our project on https://github.com/gsarti/covid-papers-browser and we use some of their code (located inside of the scripts folder), but we actually went in a totally different direction and we mostly worked on our original graph-based visualization. We also improved the search engine front end which will look like this: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/693148333514162269/694199211142676480/covid.png
The code that we made for this is in another repo: https://github.com/onefork/covid-19

In the future we aim to provide this tool for the whole dataset.

The visualization is available at: https://covid-19-papers-react.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html
