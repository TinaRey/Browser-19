# CodeVsCovid19
Repository for the hackathon CodeVsCovid19

This project aims to provide a visual way to browse through the papers related to the different coronaviruses. We developped a graph structure of a subset of these papers to show how this can be an interesting visualization for researchers that want to quickly have an overview of the existing papers.

We based our project on https://github.com/gsarti/covid-papers-browser and we use some of their code (located inside of the scripts folder), but we actually went in a totally different direction and made it more graphical and less search-based.

In the future we aim to provide this tool for the whole dataset.
